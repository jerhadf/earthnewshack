"The urgency of tackling climate change seems, finally, to be sinking in. Fear-mongering is understandably in fashion this year, with prophets of doom having no shortage of new material to draw upon. But amid the endlessly bleak portents of our collective future – birds falling out of the sky in the United States, hundreds of whales washing up on Australia’s shores, a succession of “worst-ever” natural disasters, set against a “worst-ever” US presidential election and a once-in-a-generation pandemic – there is at least one silver lining: the urgency of tackling climate change seems, finally, to be sinking in. Joe Biden, a stalwart of the status quo and favourite to win in November, is campaigning on the most ambitious climate change package in history. Totalling $2 trillion, and injecting some much-needed vitality into his veteran candidacy, the plan promises a complete transition to clean electricity by 2035 and net zero emissions by 2050. China, currently the world’s biggest emitter, has announced it will phase out fossil fuels by 2060. Much of Europe is on the same path . Boris Johnson, who has spent much of his career ridiculing wind energy, has now re-branded himself as a champion of the cause . The leaders who still refuse to follow suit – blindly clinging to the fantasy that free-market capitalism will correct itself – now sound less like the custodians of economic orthodoxy they could once claim to be, and more like the heirs of Homer Simpson: “Stupidity got us into this mess, and stupidity will get us out.” Admittedly, the gap between rhetoric and reality is always hard to identify when it comes to climate change action, and so any optimism should come with caution. Leaders and CEOs love to pronounce their deepest commitment to the planet in public, only to subvert climate change policy in private. The boom in “environmentally friendly” consumption has offered citizen-consumers a pastiche of political transformation, robbing the cause of its radical urgency, and proving far more effective at reducing the number of guilty consciences in the world than levels of carbon dioxide. According to a 2018 study , 70 percent of people in the UK and US believe that protecting the environment is primarily down to individual consumers – when just 100 companies are responsible for more than 70 percent of global emissions since 1988. As French sociologist Guy Debord once warned: “capitalism could appropriate even the most radical ideas and return them safely in the form of harmless ideologies.” Yet there are signs that the ground is shifting. As governments across the world advocate the timed closure of the fossil fuel industry, a fundamental tenet of the neoliberal era loses its ascendancy: the belief that if markets are left unregulated society’s problems will solve themselves. Capitalism’s treasured reputation for dynamism and problem-solving sits uneasily with its plodding slowness on climate change, and should be forever tarnished in the eyes of many. In light of everything we now know, the fantasy of “trickle-down” economics would be better renamed “trickle-drown” economics: unfettered markets lead inexorably to rising seas, not prosperity. Current action on climate change is still happening within the broad parameters of capitalism. Joe Biden, for example, has not abandoned the principles of profit and growth, and has controversially refused to ban fracking as part of his climate policy on this basis. Yet these shortcomings should not cloud the progress being made. There is a plausible parallel universe where, in his battle to defeat Trump, Biden felt that it was only necessary for him to recommit to the Paris Agreement and undo all the damage that Trump has done. But through concerted pressure and a growing consensus, Biden is pitching something far more powerful. This should not be taken as a reason for complacency, but rather as motivation to keep on going. These are confounding times. The outlook for our future becomes both more promising and bleaker, day by day. The scale of the climate movement has finally pushed the issue beyond the status of “true or false” debate. The sustained reckoning with racism in the US and Western Europe is remarkable in its scope and seriousness.

"Summer 2022 risks being a ‘perfect storm for glaciers’ due to soaring temperatures and a lack of winter snow, an expert warns. Glaciers in Europe’s Alps are becoming more unstable and dangerous as rising temperatures linked to climate change are reawakening what were long seen as dormant, almost fossilised sheets of ice. Italy has been baking in an early summer heatwave, and in the Italian Dolomite Mountains tragedy struck on Sunday when a glacier collapsed on the highest peak in the range – Marmolada – killing at least seven people. Another 14 people remain missing and authorities have cautioned that it is not clear how many people were on the 3,300-metre mountain when the glacier gave way. Italy’s Prime Minister Mario Draghi on Monday linked the collapse to climate change. The collapse of the glacier was “without doubt linked to the deterioration of the environment and the climate situation”, Draghi said during a visit to the headquarters of the rescue operation in the Dolomites.

"With Egypt’s COP27 less than six months away, experts are calling attention to the Middle East and North Africa region’s transition to clean energy. Global climate talks are coming to the hottest and driest part of the planet. The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region will host the next United Nations climate change conference where decision-makers from around the world will come together to agree on actions required to limit rising temperatures. Last year, governments made a pact during COP26 – the climate summit that took place in the United Kingdom’s city of Glasgow, to prevent the planet from heating more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) by mid-century, a threshold that if surpassed could have catastrophic results for humans and ecosystems. At the same time, Egypt was selected to host COP27 this November in Sharm El-Sheikh, a resort town located between the desert of the Sinai Peninsula and the Red Sea. Incidentally, COP28 will also happen in MENA in the United Arab Emirates  the following year. Since the UN meetings began back in 1995, the region has accommodated the international climate change conferences known as COPs only a few times – twice in Marrakesh, Morocco, and once in Doha, Qatar, almost a decade ago. Climate meetings are where leaders present national targets and proposals for cutting back emissions of greenhouse gases. The main objective is to get governments to prevent the release of large quantities of emissions into the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels. The problem, however, is that about 80 percent of the world’s power comes from coal, oil and gas, and most nations are heavily reliant on these for their energy needs. Current energy mixes need to be replaced with greener alternatives, but in practice, fossil fuels are still very much running the show. The International Energy Agency recorded the highest yearly level of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for the energy sector in 2021. Transforming energy systems is costly and is a difficult undertaking worldwide. For oil and gas producers in MENA, this task is even harder given that 95 percent of their electricity is generated from fossil fuels. Climate change has also been drying and warming the region faster than anywhere else on Earth, making it more vulnerable to extreme weather events such as drought. A pathway for the region that is safe and fair must be created and COP27 can serve as the platform to do that, analysts have said. “Climate change negotiations tend to focus mainly on energy and decarbonisation while other important issues such as justice and water scarcity are not getting the attention they deserve,” Kaveh Madani of United Nations University and head of Iran’s delegation to COP23 told Al Jazeera. “Prescribing identical solution measures is wrong because not all countries have access to equal resources and opportunities,” Madani added. MENA watchers have used the negotiations in Egypt to bring the region into focus, particularly regarding the challenges it faces in transitioning to clean energy. The most recent assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change left no doubt that quick and deep emission cuts will have to take place across all economies, including in MENA, to prevent the worst effects of global warming from happening. To do that, predominantly fossil fuel energy mixes in the region will need to start including more alternative sources. Renewables such as solar and wind have been considered possible alternatives. Hydropower, however, may be the least desirable because electricity is generated by reservoirs of water barricaded by large dams and excessive dam building for energy and agricultural purposes in the region has already contributed to major rivers in Iran, Syria, Iraq and Egypt drying up. “Water, energy, and environment are three interconnected factors. They are the pillars that define the quality of life in any country … If one goes wrong the others follow,” said Essam Heggy, a scientist at the University of Southern California. So, whether it is at the climate summit in Egypt or the UAE, “any discussion on clean energy in MENA will have to address the issue of water management in the region,” added Heggy. Most countries in the Middle East and North Africa have economies that depend solely on revenue derived from the production and export of oil and gas. Energy transitioning means complying with international climate agreements , a scenario in which, by the year 2050, all greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere are offset. For this to happen, MENA countries will need to move from fossil fuels to renewable energy. However, not all governments can commit to this timeframe simultaneously. With COP27 on the horizon, it is likely that more nations, including Egypt , will be pressured into submitting decarbonisation plans faster. Some wealthy countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE have already done so. But green financing opportunities are not equal across the region. Iran , for example, one of the highest carbon emitters in the world, is prohibited from receiving foreign investment to develop its renewable energy sector because of US sanctions. War-ravaged nations, such as Iraq and Syria , in the Middle East will also have trouble allocating the money needed for reconstructing cities and industries with clean energy. Moreover, decision-makers in MENA have said developed economies, such as the United States, the EU, and China – the most responsible historically for greenhouse gas pollution, should help pay for the technology they need for decarbonisation. According to a survey published by management consultancy McKinsey, lower-income fossil fuel-based nations will have to spend significantly more on transitioning given their high exposure to climate change and its damages. In their defence and the interest of fairness, mitigation cannot be expected to occur the same way across the MENA region. As Ali Ahmad, energy and climate change specialist at the World Bank told Al Jazeera, “obstacles facing the region are very country specific, each one has its own political economy considerations that shapes the pace and depth of its energy transition pathway.” Global oil and gas markets have changed significantly since COP26 concluded in Glasgow, Scotland, last November with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the plethora of sanctions that followed on Moscow. To keep the security and costs of its energy sector in check, the EU will have to find a new partner to provide it with the gas it currently gets from Russia. Specfically , countries in the Middle East and North Africa. Iran, Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Egypt have some of the world’s largest gas reserves, and possess the expertise in using it for both domestic energy intake, as well as for exports. “It’s really likely that over the next few years Europe will start replacing its gas imports from Russia, and so basically the gas that is produced in MENA will find a renewed market at possibly a higher price,” Ahmad said. Egypt and Qatar are already reaping the rewards having signed major deals with the Europeans for the development of the liquefied form of natural gas (LNG), which can be easily delivered by tankers rather than pipelines. Even though natural gas is notoriously bad for the atmosphere and releases huge amounts of methane – the second-leading contributor to human-induced climate change – it is being championed as a bridging agent that can help pave the way for MENA’s transition to clean energy. Natural gas emits about 45 percent less CO2 than oil and coal and has been recognised as the cleanest form of fossil fuel by the International Energy Agency. Solar, wind, and green hydrogen are better options to constitute MENA’s future energy mixes, but “we need to check and evaluate which one of these fuels has a well-established supply chain and existing infrastructure to fill the gap in energy transition for now, and the answer is natural gas,” Farid Safari , visiting research fellow at Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, told Al Jazeera. Ultimately for the Middle East and North Africa, “the energy mix will differ by country and really depends on the region and the range of circumstances – including renewable resources, access to capital, and available alternatives,” Ali al-Saffar, Middle East and North Africa programme manager at the International Energy Agency, told Al Jazeera.   ",Can MENA countries fight climate change the same way?,can-mena-countries-fight-climate-change-the-same-way,34:08.0,30:38.1,"Egypt is set to host the next United Nations climate change conference (COP27) in November, with attention being drawn to the challenges the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region faces in transitioning to clean energy.

MENA watchers have used the negotiations in Egypt to bring the region into focus, particularly regarding the challenges it faces in transitioning to clean energy. The most recent assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change left no doubt that quick and deep emission cuts will have to take place across all economies, including in MENA, to prevent the worst effects of global warming from happening. To do that, predominantly fossil fuel energy mixes in the region will need to start including more alternative sources. Renewables such as solar and wind have been considered possible alternatives. Hydropower, however, may be the least desirable because electricity is generated by reservoirs of water barricaded by large dams and excessive dam building for energy and agricultural purposes in the region has already contributed to major rivers in Iran, Syria, Iraq and Egypt drying up. “Water, energy, and environment are three interconnected factors. They are the pillars that define the quality of life in any country … If one goes wrong the others follow,” said Essam Heggy, a scientist at the University of Southern California. So, whether it is at the climate summit in Egypt or the UAE, “any discussion on clean energy in MENA will have to address the issue of water management in the region,” added Heggy. Most countries in the Middle East and North Africa have economies that depend solely on revenue derived from the production and export of oil and gas. Energy transitioning means complying with international climate agreements , a scenario in which, by the year 2050, all greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere are offset. For this to happen, MENA countries will need to move from fossil fuels to renewable energy. However, not all governments can commit to this timeframe simultaneously. With COP27 on the horizon, it is likely that more nations, including Egypt , will be pressured into submitting decarbonisation plans faster. Some wealthy countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE have already done so. But green financing opportunities are not equal across the region. Iran , for example, one of the highest carbon emitters in the world, is prohibited from receiving foreign investment to develop its renewable energy sector because of US sanctions. War-ravaged nations, such as Iraq and Syria , in the Middle East will also have trouble allocating the money needed for reconstructing cities and industries with clean energy. Moreover, decision-makers in MENA have said developed economies, such as the United States, the EU, and China – the most responsible historically for greenhouse gas pollution, should help pay for the technology they need for decarbonisation. According to a survey published by management consultancy McKinsey, lower-income fossil fuel-based nations will have to spend significantly more on transitioning given their high exposure to climate change and its damages. In their defence and the interest of fairness, mitigation cannot be expected to occur the same way across the MENA region. As Ali Ahmad, energy and climate change specialist at the World Bank told Al Jazeera, “obstacles facing the region are very country specific, each one has its own political economy considerations that shapes the pace and depth of its energy transition pathway.” Global oil and gas markets have changed significantly since COP26 concluded in Glasgow, Scotland, last November with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the plethora of sanctions that followed on Moscow. To keep the security and costs of its energy sector in check, the EU will have to find a new partner to provide it with the gas it currently gets from Russia. Specfically , countries in the Middle East and North Africa. Iran, Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Egypt have some of the world’s largest gas reserves, and possess the expertise in using it for both domestic energy intake, as well as for exports. “It’s really likely that over the next few years Europe will start replacing its gas imports from Russia, and so basically the gas that is produced in MENA will find a renewed market at possibly a higher price,” Ahmad said. Egypt and Qatar are already reaping the rewards having signed major deals with the Europeans for the development of the liquefied form of natural gas (LNG), which can be easily delivered by tankers rather than pipelines. Even though natural gas is notoriously bad for the atmosphere and releases huge amounts of methane – the second-leading contributor to human-induced climate change – it is being championed as a bridging agent that can help pave the way for MENA’s transition to clean energy. Natural gas emits about 45 percent less CO2 than oil and coal and has been recognised as the cleanest form of fossil fuel by the International Energy Agency. Solar, wind, and green hydrogen are better options to constitute MENA’s future energy mixes, but “we need to check and evaluate which one of these fuels has a well-established supply chain and existing infrastructure to fill the gap in energy transition for now, and the answer is natural gas,” Farid Safari , visiting research fellow at Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, told Al Jazeera. Ultimately for the Middle East and North Africa, “the energy mix will differ by country and really depends on the region and the range of circumstances – including renewable resources, access to capital, and available alternatives,” Ali al-Saffar, Middle East and North Africa programme manager at the International Energy Agency, told Al Jazeera.   ",Can MENA countries fight climate change the same way?,can-mena-countries-fight-climate-change-the-same-way,34:08.0,30:38.1,"Egypt is set to host the next United Nations climate change conference (COP27) in November, with attention being drawn to the challenges the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region faces in transitioning to clean energy.

"With Egypt’s COP27 less than six months away, experts are calling attention to the Middle East and North Africa region’s transition to clean energy. Global climate talks are coming to the hottest and driest part of the planet. The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region will host the next United Nations climate change conference where decision-makers from around the world will come together to agree on actions required to limit rising temperatures. Last year, governments made a pact during COP26 – the climate summit that took place in the United Kingdom’s city of Glasgow, to prevent the planet from heating more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) by mid-century, a threshold that if surpassed could have catastrophic results for humans and ecosystems. At the same time, Egypt was selected to host COP27 this November in Sharm El-Sheikh, a resort town located between the desert of the Sinai Peninsula and the Red Sea. Incidentally, COP28 will also happen in MENA in the United Arab Emirates  the following year. Since the UN meetings began back in 1995, the region has accommodated the international climate change conferences known as COPs only a few times – twice in Marrakesh, Morocco, and once in Doha, Qatar, almost a decade ago. Climate meetings are where leaders present national targets and proposals for cutting back emissions of greenhouse gases. The main objective is to get governments to prevent the release of large quantities of emissions into the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels. The problem, however, is that about 80 percent of the world’s power comes from coal, oil and gas, and most nations are heavily reliant on these for their energy needs. Current energy mixes need to be replaced with greener alternatives, but in practice, fossil fuels are still very much running the show. The International Energy Agency recorded the highest yearly level of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for the energy sector in 2021. Transforming energy systems is costly and is a difficult undertaking worldwide. For oil and gas producers in MENA, this task is even harder given that 95 percent of their electricity is generated from fossil fuels.

The International Energy Agency recorded the highest yearly level of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for the energy sector in 2021. Transforming energy systems is costly and is a difficult undertaking worldwide. For oil and gas producers in MENA, this task is even harder given that 95 percent of their electricity is generated from fossil fuels. Climate change has also been drying and warming the region faster than anywhere else on Earth, making it more vulnerable to extreme weather events such as drought. A pathway for the region that is safe and fair must be created and COP27 can serve as the platform to do that, analysts have said. “Climate change negotiations tend to focus mainly on energy and decarbonisation while other important issues such as justice and water scarcity are not getting the attention they deserve,” Kaveh Madani of United Nations University and head of Iran’s delegation to COP23 told Al Jazeera. “Prescribing identical solution measures is wrong because not all countries have access to equal resources and opportunities,” Madani added. MENA watchers have used the negotiations in Egypt to bring the region into focus, particularly regarding the challenges it faces in transitioning to clean energy. The most recent assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change left no doubt that quick and deep emission cuts will have to take place across all economies, including in MENA, to prevent the worst effects of global warming from happening. To do that, predominantly fossil fuel energy mixes in the region will need to start including more alternative sources. Renewables such as solar and wind have been considered possible alternatives. Hydropower, however, may be the least desirable because electricity is generated by reservoirs of water barricaded by large dams and excessive dam building for energy and agricultural purposes in the region has already contributed to major rivers in Iran, Syria, Iraq and Egypt drying up. “Water, energy, and environment are three interconnected factors. They are the pillars that define the quality of life in any country … If one goes wrong the others follow,” said Essam Heggy, a scientist at the University of Southern California. So, whether it is at the climate summit in Egypt or the UAE, “any discussion on clean energy in MENA will have to address the issue of water management in the region,” added Heggy. Most countries in the Middle East and North Africa have economies that depend solely on revenue derived from the production and export of oil and gas. Energy transitioning means complying with international climate agreements , a scenario in which, by the year 2050, all greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere are offset. For this to happen, MENA countries will need to move from fossil fuels to renewable energy. However, not all governments can commit to this timeframe simultaneously. With COP27 on the horizon, it is likely that more nations, including Egypt , will be pressured into submitting decarbonisation plans faster. Some wealthy countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE have already done so. But green financing opportunities are not equal across the region. Iran , for example, one of the highest carbon emitters in the world, is prohibited from receiving foreign investment to develop its renewable energy sector because of US sanctions. War-ravaged nations, such as Iraq and Syria , in the Middle East will also have trouble allocating the money needed for reconstructing cities and industries with clean energy. Moreover, decision-makers in MENA have said developed economies, such as the United States, the EU, and China – the most responsible historically for greenhouse gas pollution, should help pay for the technology they need for decarbonisation. According to a survey published by management consultancy McKinsey, lower-income fossil fuel-based nations will have to spend significantly more on transitioning given their high exposure to climate change and its damages. In their defence and the interest of fairness, mitigation cannot be expected to occur the same way across the MENA region. As Ali Ahmad, energy and climate change specialist at the World Bank told Al Jazeera, “obstacles facing the region are very country specific, each one has its own political economy considerations that shapes the pace and depth of its energy transition pathway.” Global oil and gas markets have changed significantly since COP26 concluded in Glasgow, Scotland, last November with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the plethora of sanctions that followed on Moscow. To keep the security and costs of its energy sector in check, the EU will have to find a new partner to provide it with the gas it currently gets from Russia. Specfically , countries in the Middle East and North Africa. Iran, Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Egypt have some of the world’s largest gas reserves, and possess the expertise in using it for both domestic energy intake, as well as for exports. “It’s really likely that over the next few years Europe will start replacing its gas imports from Russia, and so basically the gas that is produced in MENA will find a renewed market at possibly a higher price,” Ahmad said. Egypt and Qatar are already reaping the rewards having signed major deals with the Europeans for the development of the liquefied form of natural gas (LNG), which can be easily delivered by tankers rather than pipelines. Even though natural gas is notoriously bad for the atmosphere and releases huge amounts of methane – the second-leading contributor to human-induced climate change – it is being championed as a bridging agent that can help pave the way for MENA’s transition to clean energy. Natural gas emits about 45 percent less CO2 than oil and coal and has been recognised as the cleanest form of fossil fuel by the International Energy Agency. Solar, wind, and green hydrogen are better options to constitute MENA’s future energy mixes, but “we need to check and evaluate which one of these fuels has a well-established supply chain and existing infrastructure to fill the gap in energy transition for now, and the answer is natural gas,” Farid Safari , visiting research fellow at Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, told Al Jazeera. Ultimately for the Middle East and North Africa, “the energy mix will differ by country and really depends on the region and the range of circumstances – including renewable resources, access to capital, and available alternatives,” Ali al-Saffar, Middle East and North Africa programme manager at the International Energy Agency, told Al Jazeera.   ",Can MENA countries fight climate change the same way?,can-mena-countries-fight-climate-change-the-same-way,34:08.0,30:38.1,"Egypt is set to host the next United Nations climate change conference (COP27) in November, with attention being drawn to the challenges the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region faces in transitioning to clean energy.

"With Egypt’s COP27 less than six months away, experts are calling attention to the Middle East and North Africa region’s transition to clean energy. Global climate talks are coming to the hottest and driest part of the planet. The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region will host the next United Nations climate change conference where decision-makers from around the world will come together to agree on actions required to limit rising temperatures. Last year, governments made a pact during COP26 – the climate summit that took place in the United Kingdom’s city of Glasgow, to prevent the planet from heating more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) by mid-century, a threshold that if surpassed could have catastrophic results for humans and ecosystems. At the same time, Egypt was selected to host COP27 this November in Sharm El-Sheikh, a resort town located between the desert of the Sinai Peninsula and the Red Sea. Incidentally, COP28 will also happen in MENA in the United Arab Emirates  the following year. Since the UN meetings began back in 1995, the region has accommodated the international climate change conferences known as COPs only a few times – twice in Marrakesh, Morocco, and once in Doha, Qatar, almost a decade ago. Climate meetings are where leaders present national targets and proposals for cutting back emissions of greenhouse gases. The main objective is to get governments to prevent the release of large quantities of emissions into the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels.

Since the UN meetings began back in 1995, the region has accommodated the international climate change conferences known as COPs only a few times – twice in Marrakesh, Morocco, and once in Doha, Qatar, almost a decade ago. Climate meetings are where leaders present national targets and proposals for cutting back emissions of greenhouse gases. The main objective is to get governments to prevent the release of large quantities of emissions into the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels. The problem, however, is that about 80 percent of the world’s power comes from coal, oil and gas, and most nations are heavily reliant on these for their energy needs. Current energy mixes need to be replaced with greener alternatives, but in practice, fossil fuels are still very much running the show. The International Energy Agency recorded the highest yearly level of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for the energy sector in 2021. Transforming energy systems is costly and is a difficult undertaking worldwide. For oil and gas producers in MENA, this task is even harder given that 95 percent of their electricity is generated from fossil fuels. Climate change has also been drying and warming the region faster than anywhere else on Earth, making it more vulnerable to extreme weather events such as drought. A pathway for the region that is safe and fair must be created and COP27 can serve as the platform to do that, analysts have said. “Climate change negotiations tend to focus mainly on energy and decarbonisation while other important issues such as justice and water scarcity are not getting the attention they deserve,” Kaveh Madani of United Nations University and head of Iran’s delegation to COP23 told Al Jazeera. “Prescribing identical solution measures is wrong because not all countries have access to equal resources and opportunities,” Madani added. MENA watchers have used the negotiations in Egypt to bring the region into focus, particularly regarding the challenges it faces in transitioning to clean energy. The most recent assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change left no doubt that quick and deep emission cuts will have to take place across all economies, including in MENA, to prevent the worst effects of global warming from happening. To do that, predominantly fossil fuel energy mixes in the region will need to start including more alternative sources. Renewables such as solar and wind have been considered possible alternatives. Hydropower, however, may be the least desirable because electricity is generated by reservoirs of water barricaded by large dams and excessive dam building for energy and agricultural purposes in the region has already contributed to major rivers in Iran, Syria, Iraq and Egypt drying up. “Water, energy, and environment are three interconnected factors. They are the pillars that define the quality of life in any country … If one goes wrong the others follow,” said Essam Heggy, a scientist at the University of Southern California. So, whether it is at the climate summit in Egypt or the UAE, “any discussion on clean energy in MENA will have to address the issue of water management in the region,” added Heggy. Most countries in the Middle East and North Africa have economies that depend solely on revenue derived from the production and export of oil and gas. Energy transitioning means complying with international climate agreements , a scenario in which, by the year 2050, all greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere are offset. For this to happen, MENA countries will need to move from fossil fuels to renewable energy. However, not all governments can commit to this timeframe simultaneously. With COP27 on the horizon, it is likely that more nations, including Egypt , will be pressured into submitting decarbonisation plans faster. Some wealthy countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE have already done so. But green financing opportunities are not equal across the region. Iran , for example, one of the highest carbon emitters in the world, is prohibited from receiving foreign investment to develop its renewable energy sector because of US sanctions. War-ravaged nations, such as Iraq and Syria , in the Middle East will also have trouble allocating the money needed for reconstructing cities and industries with clean energy. Moreover, decision-makers in MENA have said developed economies, such as the United States, the EU, and China – the most responsible historically for greenhouse gas pollution, should help pay for the technology they need for decarbonisation. According to a survey published by management consultancy McKinsey, lower-income fossil fuel-based nations will have to spend significantly more on transitioning given their high exposure to climate change and its damages. In their defence and the interest of fairness, mitigation cannot be expected to occur the same way across the MENA region. As Ali Ahmad, energy and climate change specialist at the World Bank told Al Jazeera, “obstacles facing the region are very country specific, each one has its own political economy considerations that shapes the pace and depth of its energy transition pathway.” Global oil and gas markets have changed significantly since COP26 concluded in Glasgow, Scotland, last November with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the plethora of sanctions that followed on Moscow. To keep the security and costs of its energy sector in check, the EU will have to find a new partner to provide it with the gas it currently gets from Russia. Specfically , countries in the Middle East and North Africa. Iran, Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Egypt have some of the world’s largest gas reserves, and possess the expertise in using it for both domestic energy intake, as well as for exports. “It’s really likely that over the next few years Europe will start replacing its gas imports from Russia, and so basically the gas that is produced in MENA will find a renewed market at possibly a higher price,” Ahmad said. Egypt and Qatar are already reaping the rewards having signed major deals with the Europeans for the development of the liquefied form of natural gas (LNG), which can be easily delivered by tankers rather than pipelines. Even though natural gas is notoriously bad for the atmosphere and releases huge amounts of methane – the second-leading contributor to human-induced climate change – it is being championed as a bridging agent that can help pave the way for MENA’s transition to clean energy. Natural gas emits about 45 percent less CO2 than oil and coal and has been recognised as the cleanest form of fossil fuel by the International Energy Agency. Solar, wind, and green hydrogen are better options to constitute MENA’s future energy mixes, but “we need to check and evaluate which one of these fuels has a well-established supply chain and existing infrastructure to fill the gap in energy transition for now, and the answer is natural gas,” Farid Safari , visiting research fellow at Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, told Al Jazeera. Ultimately for the Middle East and North Africa, “the energy mix will differ by country and really depends on the region and the range of circumstances – including renewable resources, access to capital, and available alternatives,” Ali al-Saffar, Middle East and North Africa programme manager at the International Energy Agency, told Al Jazeera.   ",Can MENA countries fight climate change the same way?,can-mena-countries-fight-climate-change-the-same-way,34:08.0,30:38.1,"Egypt is set to host the next United Nations climate change conference (COP27) in November, with attention being drawn to the challenges the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region faces in transitioning to clean energy.

"With Egypt’s COP27 less than six months away, experts are calling attention to the Middle East and North Africa region’s transition to clean energy. Global climate talks are coming to the hottest and driest part of the planet.

Last year, governments made a pact during COP26 – the climate summit that took place in the United Kingdom’s city of Glasgow, to prevent the planet from heating more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) by mid-century, a threshold that if surpassed could have catastrophic results for humans and ecosystems.

Last year, governments made a pact during COP26 – the climate summit that took place in the United Kingdom’s city of Glasgow, to prevent the planet from heating more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) by mid-century, a threshold that if surpassed could have catastrophic results for humans and ecosystems. At the same time, Egypt was selected to host COP27 this November in Sharm El-Sheikh, a resort town located between the desert of the Sinai Peninsula and the Red Sea. Incidentally, COP28 will also happen in MENA in the United Arab Emirates  the following year. Since the UN meetings began back in 1995, the region has accommodated the international climate change conferences known as COPs only a few times – twice in Marrakesh, Morocco, and once in Doha, Qatar, almost a decade ago. Climate meetings are where leaders present national targets and proposals for cutting back emissions of greenhouse gases. The main objective is to get governments to prevent the release of large quantities of emissions into the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels. The problem, however, is that about 80 percent of the world’s power comes from coal, oil and gas, and most nations are heavily reliant on these for their energy needs. Current energy mixes need to be replaced with greener alternatives, but in practice, fossil fuels are still very much running the show. The International Energy Agency recorded the highest yearly level of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for the energy sector in 2021. Transforming energy systems is costly and is a difficult undertaking worldwide. For oil and gas producers in MENA, this task is even harder given that 95 percent of their electricity is generated from fossil fuels. Climate change has also been drying and warming the region faster than anywhere else on Earth, making it more vulnerable to extreme weather events such as drought. A pathway for the region that is safe and fair must be created and COP27 can serve as the platform to do that, analysts have said. “Climate change negotiations tend to focus mainly on energy and decarbonisation while other important issues such as justice and water scarcity are not getting the attention they deserve,” Kaveh Madani of United Nations University and head of Iran’s delegation to COP23 told Al Jazeera. “Prescribing identical solution measures is wrong because not all countries have access to equal resources and opportunities,” Madani added. MENA watchers have used the negotiations in Egypt to bring the region into focus, particularly regarding the challenges it faces in transitioning to clean energy. The most recent assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change left no doubt that quick and deep emission cuts will have to take place across all economies, including in MENA, to prevent the worst effects of global warming from happening. To do that, predominantly fossil fuel energy mixes in the region will need to start including more alternative sources. Renewables such as solar and wind have been considered possible alternatives. Hydropower, however, may be the least desirable because electricity is generated by reservoirs of water barricaded by large dams and excessive dam building for energy and agricultural purposes in the region has already contributed to major rivers in Iran, Syria, Iraq and Egypt drying up. “Water, energy, and environment are three interconnected factors. They are the pillars that define the quality of life in any country … If one goes wrong the others follow,” said Essam Heggy, a scientist at the University of Southern California. So, whether it is at the climate summit in Egypt or the UAE, “any discussion on clean energy in MENA will have to address the issue of water management in the region,” added Heggy. Most countries in the Middle East and North Africa have economies that depend solely on revenue derived from the production and export of oil and gas. Energy transitioning means complying with international climate agreements , a scenario in which, by the year 2050, all greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere are offset. For this to happen, MENA countries will need to move from fossil fuels to renewable energy. However, not all governments can commit to this timeframe simultaneously. With COP27 on the horizon, it is likely that more nations, including Egypt , will be pressured into submitting decarbonisation plans faster. Some wealthy countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE have already done so. But green financing opportunities are not equal across the region. Iran , for example, one of the highest carbon emitters in the world, is prohibited from receiving foreign investment to develop its renewable energy sector because of US sanctions. War-ravaged nations, such as Iraq and Syria , in the Middle East will also have trouble allocating the money needed for reconstructing cities and industries with clean energy. Moreover, decision-makers in MENA have said developed economies, such as the United States, the EU, and China – the most responsible historically for greenhouse gas pollution, should help pay for the technology they need for decarbonisation. According to a survey published by management consultancy McKinsey, lower-income fossil fuel-based nations will have to spend significantly more on transitioning given their high exposure to climate change and its damages. In their defence and the interest of fairness, mitigation cannot be expected to occur the same way across the MENA region. As Ali Ahmad, energy and climate change specialist at the World Bank told Al Jazeera, “obstacles facing the region are very country specific, each one has its own political economy considerations that shapes the pace and depth of its energy transition pathway.” Global oil and gas markets have changed significantly since COP26 concluded in Glasgow, Scotland, last November with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the plethora of sanctions that followed on Moscow. To keep the security and costs of its energy sector in check, the EU will have to find a new partner to provide it with the gas it currently gets from Russia. Specfically , countries in the Middle East and North Africa. Iran, Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Egypt have some of the world’s largest gas reserves, and possess the expertise in using it for both domestic energy intake, as well as for exports. “It’s really likely that over the next few years Europe will start replacing its gas imports from Russia, and so basically the gas that is produced in MENA will find a renewed market at possibly a higher price,” Ahmad said. Egypt and Qatar are already reaping the rewards having signed major deals with the Europeans for the development of the liquefied form of natural gas (LNG), which can be easily delivered by tankers rather than pipelines. Even though natural gas is notoriously bad for the atmosphere and releases huge amounts of methane – the second-leading contributor to human-induced climate change – it is being championed as a bridging agent that can help pave the way for MENA’s transition to clean energy. Natural gas emits about 45 percent less CO2 than oil and coal and has been recognised as the cleanest form of fossil fuel by the International Energy Agency. Solar, wind, and green hydrogen are better options to constitute MENA’s future energy mixes, but “we need to check and evaluate which one of these fuels has a well-established supply chain and existing infrastructure to fill the gap in energy transition for now, and the answer is natural gas,” Farid Safari , visiting research fellow at Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, told Al Jazeera. Ultimately for the Middle East and North Africa, “the energy mix will differ by country and really depends on the region and the range of circumstances – including renewable resources, access to capital, and available alternatives,” Ali al-Saffar, Middle East and North Africa programme manager at the International Energy Agency, told Al Jazeera.   ",Can MENA countries fight climate change the same way?,can-mena-countries-fight-climate-change-the-same-way,34:08.0,30:38.1,"Egypt is set to host the next United Nations climate change conference (COP27) in November, with attention being drawn to the challenges the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region faces in transitioning to clean energy.

"With Egypt’s COP27 less than six months away, experts are calling attention to the Middle East and North Africa region’s transition to clean energy. Global climate talks are coming to the hottest and driest part of the planet. The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region will host the next United Nations climate change conference where decision-makers from around the world will come together to agree on actions required to limit rising temperatures. Last year, governments made a pact during COP26 – the climate summit that took place in the United Kingdom’s city of Glasgow, to prevent the planet from heating more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) by mid-century, a threshold that if surpassed could have catastrophic results for humans and ecosystems. At the same time, Egypt was selected to host COP27 this November in Sharm El-Sheikh, a resort town located between the desert of the Sinai Peninsula and the Red Sea. Incidentally, COP28 will also happen in MENA in the United Arab Emirates  the following year. Since the UN meetings began back in 1995, the region has accommodated the international climate change conferences known as COPs only a few times – twice in Marrakesh, Morocco, and once in Doha, Qatar, almost a decade ago. Climate meetings are where leaders present national targets and proposals for cutting back emissions of greenhouse gases. The main objective is to get governments to prevent the release of large quantities of emissions into the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels. The problem, however, is that about 80 percent of the world’s power comes from coal, oil and gas, and most nations are heavily reliant on these for their energy needs. Current energy mixes need to be replaced with greener alternatives, but in practice, fossil fuels are still very much running the show. The International Energy Agency recorded the highest yearly level of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for the energy sector in 2021. Transforming energy systems is costly and is a difficult undertaking worldwide. For oil and gas producers in MENA, this task is even harder given that 95 percent of their electricity is generated from fossil fuels. Climate change has also been drying and warming the region faster than anywhere else on Earth, making it more vulnerable to extreme weather events such as drought. A pathway for the region that is safe and fair must be created and COP27 can serve as the platform to do that, analysts have said. “Climate change negotiations tend to focus mainly on energy and decarbonisation while other important issues such as justice and water scarcity are not getting the attention they deserve,” Kaveh Madani of United Nations University and head of Iran’s delegation to COP23 told Al Jazeera. “Prescribing identical solution measures is wrong because not all countries have access to equal resources and opportunities,” Madani added. MENA watchers have used the negotiations in Egypt to bring the region into focus, particularly regarding the challenges it faces in transitioning to clean energy. The most recent assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change left no doubt that quick and deep emission cuts will have to take place across all economies, including in MENA, to prevent the worst effects of global warming from happening. To do that, predominantly fossil fuel energy mixes in the region will need to start including more alternative sources. Renewables such as solar and wind have been considered possible alternatives. Hydropower, however, may be the least desirable because electricity is generated by reservoirs of water barricaded by large dams and excessive dam building for energy and agricultural purposes in the region has already contributed to major rivers in Iran, Syria, Iraq and Egypt drying up. “Water, energy, and environment are three interconnected factors. They are the pillars that define the quality of life in any country … If one goes wrong the others follow,” said Essam Heggy, a scientist at the University of Southern California. So, whether it is at the climate summit in Egypt or the UAE, “any discussion on clean energy in MENA will have to address the issue of water management in the region,” added Heggy. Most countries in the Middle East and North Africa have economies that depend solely on revenue derived from the production and export of oil and gas. Energy transitioning means complying with international climate agreements , a scenario in which, by the year 2050, all greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere are offset. For this to happen, MENA countries will need to move from fossil fuels to renewable energy. However, not all governments can commit to this timeframe simultaneously. With COP27 on the horizon, it is likely that more nations, including Egypt , will be pressured into submitting decarbonisation plans faster. Some wealthy countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE have already done so. But green financing opportunities are not equal across the region. Iran , for example, one of the highest carbon emitters in the world, is prohibited from receiving foreign investment to develop its renewable energy sector because of US sanctions. War-ravaged nations, such as Iraq and Syria , in the Middle East will also have trouble allocating the money needed for reconstructing cities and industries with clean energy. Moreover, decision-makers in MENA have said developed economies, such as the United States, the EU, and China – the most responsible historically for greenhouse gas pollution, should help pay for the technology they need for decarbonisation. According to a survey published by management consultancy McKinsey, lower-income fossil fuel-based nations will have to spend significantly more on transitioning given their high exposure to climate change and its damages. In their defence and the interest of fairness, mitigation cannot be expected to occur the same way across the MENA region. As Ali Ahmad, energy and climate change specialist at the World Bank told Al Jazeera, “obstacles facing the region are very country specific, each one has its own political economy considerations that shapes the pace and depth of its energy transition pathway.” Global oil and gas markets have changed significantly since COP26 concluded in Glasgow, Scotland, last November with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the plethora of sanctions that followed on Moscow. To keep the security and costs of its energy sector in check, the EU will have to find a new partner to provide it with the gas it currently gets from Russia. Specfically , countries in the Middle East and North Africa. Iran, Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Egypt have some of the world’s largest gas reserves, and possess the expertise in using it for both domestic energy intake, as well as for exports. “It’s really likely that over the next few years Europe will start replacing its gas imports from Russia, and so basically the gas that is produced in MENA will find a renewed market at possibly a higher price,” Ahmad said. Egypt and Qatar are already reaping the rewards having signed major deals with the Europeans for the development of the liquefied form of natural gas (LNG), which can be easily delivered by tankers rather than pipelines. Even though natural gas is notoriously bad for the atmosphere and releases huge amounts of methane – the second-leading contributor to human-induced climate change – it is being championed as a bridging agent that can help pave the way for MENA’s transition to clean energy. Natural gas emits about 45 percent less CO2 than oil and coal and has been recognised as the cleanest form of fossil fuel by the International Energy Agency. Solar, wind, and green hydrogen are better options to constitute MENA’s future energy mixes, but “we need to check and evaluate which one of these fuels has a well-established supply chain and existing infrastructure to fill the gap in energy transition for now, and the answer is natural gas,” Farid Safari , visiting research fellow at Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, told Al Jazeera. Ultimately for the Middle East and North Africa, “the energy mix will differ by country and really depends on the region and the range of circumstances – including renewable resources, access to capital, and available alternatives,” Ali al-Saffar, Middle East and North Africa programme manager at the International Energy Agency, told Al Jazeera.   ",Can MENA countries fight climate change the same way?,can-mena-countries-fight-climate-change-the-same-way,34:08.0,30:38.1,"Egypt is set to host the next United Nations climate change conference (COP27) in November, with attention being drawn to the challenges the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region faces in transitioning to clean energy.

"Red Cross says the world has been hit by more than 100 climate change-related disasters since the WHO declared the pandemic. The world should react with the same urgency to climate change as is to the coronavirus crisis, the Red Cross says, warning that global warming poses a greater threat than COVID-19. Even as the pandemic rages, climate change is not taking a break from wreaking havoc, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said in a report. In its report on global catastrophes since the 1960s, the Geneva-based organisation pointed out that the world had been hit by more than 100 disasters – many of them climate-related – since the World Health Organization declared the pandemic in March. More than 50 million people had been affected, it said. “Of course, the COVID is there, it’s in front of us, it is affecting our families, our friends, our relatives,” IFRC Secretary-General Jagan Chapagain told a virtual news conference. “It’s a very, very serious crisis the world is facing currently,” he said of the pandemic, which has already killed more than 1.3 million people. But, he warned, the IFRC expects “climate change will have a more significant medium and long term impact on the human life and on Earth”. And while it looks increasingly likely that one or several vaccines would soon become available against COVID-19, Chapagain stressed that “unfortunately, there is no vaccine for climate change”. Global efforts to tackle climate change are currently failing to protect the people in greatest need, according to IFRC’s World Disasters Report 2020. 👉  https://t.co/YYoTC77Xxp #WorldDisastersReport  pic.twitter.com/V1WuPMBxji — IFRC (@ifrc) November 17, 2020 When it comes to global warming, he warned, “it will require a much more sustained action and investment to really protect the human life on this Earth”. The frequency and intensity of extreme weather and climate-related events have been steadily climbing since the 1960s, said the IFRC. In 2019 alone, the world was hit by 308 natural disasters – 77 percent of them climate or weather-related – killing some 24,400 people. The number of climate and weather-related disasters has surged by nearly 35 percent since the 1990s, IFRC said, calling it a “deadly development”. Weather and climate-related disasters have killed more than 410,000 people over the past decade, most of them in poorer countries, with heatwaves and storms proving the most deadly, the report said. Faced with this threat, which “literally threatens our long-term survival”, IFRC called on the international community to act with the urgency required. “These disasters are already on the doorstep in every country around the world,” it said. “With challenges like these, international solidarity is not only a moral responsibility but also the smart thing to do. “Investing in resilience in the most vulnerable places is more cost-effective than to accept continued increases in the cost of humanitarian response, and contributes to a safer, more prosperous and sustainable world for everyone,” it added. 		 					 
				 		 The IFRC estimated that around $50bn would be needed annually over the next decade to help 50 developing countries adapt to the changing climate. It stressed that that amount was “dwarfed by the global response to the economic impact of COVID-19,” which has already passed $10 trillion. It also lamented that much of the money invested so far in climate change prevention and mitigation was not going to the developing countries who are most at risk. “Our first responsibility is to protect communities that are most exposed and vulnerable to climate risks,” Chapagain said, warning that “our research demonstrates that the world is collectively failing to do this.” “There is a clear disconnect between where the climate risk is the greatest and where climate adaptation funding goes,” he said. “This disconnection could very well cost lives.”

Weather and climate-related disasters have killed more than 410,000 people over the past decade, most of them in poorer countries, with heatwaves and storms proving the most deadly, the report said. Faced with this threat, which “literally threatens our long-term survival”, IFRC called on the international community to act with the urgency required. “These disasters are already on the doorstep in every country around the world,” it said. “With challenges like these, international solidarity is not only a moral responsibility but also the smart thing to do. “Investing in resilience in the most vulnerable places is more cost-effective than to accept continued increases in the cost of humanitarian response, and contributes to a safer, more prosperous and sustainable world for everyone,” it added. 		 					 
				 		 The IFRC estimated that around $50bn would be needed annually over the next decade to help 50 developing countries adapt to the changing climate. It stressed that that amount was “dwarfed by the global response to the economic impact of COVID-19,” which has already passed $10 trillion. It also lamented that much of the money invested so far in climate change prevention and mitigation was not going to the developing countries who are most at risk. “Our first responsibility is to protect communities that are most exposed and vulnerable to climate risks,” Chapagain said, warning that “our research demonstrates that the world is collectively failing to do this.” “There is a clear disconnect between where the climate risk is the greatest and where climate adaptation funding goes,” he said. “This disconnection could very well cost lives.” 		 					 
				 		 ",Global warming bigger threat than coronavirus: Red Cross,climate-change-bigger-threat-than-covid-red-cross,28:01.0,30:38.6,"The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has warned that climate change is a far greater threat to the world than the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting that more than 100 climate change-related disasters have happened since the World Health Organisation declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The growth in extreme weather and climate-related events has been steadily increasing since the 1960s, with 77% of natural disasters in 2019 being weather or climate-related. The IFRC has called on the international community to act urgently to address climate change and has recommended an annual investment of $50bn over the next decade to help vulnerable communities adapt to the changing climate.","1. Climate change: This refers to the long term changes in the Earth's climate, including changes in temperature, precipitation, and weather patterns, caused by human activities like burning of fossil fuels and deforestation.

2. Extreme weather: This is a term used to describe weather events that are far outside the normal range of weather patterns. This includes events like hurricanes, heat waves, and extreme rainfall.

3. Natural disasters: These are events that occur as a result of natural phenomena, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, and floods. 

4. Vulnerable communities: These are groups of people that are at a higher risk of being affected by climate change or natural disasters, often due to factors like poverty, lack of access to resources, and living in areas that are prone to weather-related events.",,,
"Therefore, climate action should be central to our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The speed and scope of the coronavirus outbreak have taken world governments by surprise and left the stock market reeling. Since the virus first appeared in China’s Hubei province, it has infected over 700,000 people and killed more than 33,000 across the world in less than six months. The interconnectedness of our globalised world facilitated the spread of COVID-19. The disruption this continues to cause has made evident societal dependence on   global production systems. The pandemic has forced governments into a difficult balancing act between ensuring public safety and wellbeing and maintaining profit margins and growth targets. Ultimately, the prospect of a large death toll and the collapse of health systems have forced countries to put millions of people on lockdown. These sweeping and unprecedented measures taken by the government and international institutions could not but make some of us wonder about another global emergency that needs urgent action – climate change.  The two emergencies are in fact quite similar. Both have their roots in the world’s current economic model – that of the pursuit of infinite growth at the expense of the environment on which our survival depends – and both are deadly and disruptive. In fact, one may argue that the pandemic is part of climate change and therefore, our response to it should not be limited to containing the spread of the virus. What we thought was “normal” before the pandemic was already a crisis and so returning to it cannot be an option. Despite the persistent climate denialism in some policy circles, by now it is clear to the majority across the world that climate change is happening as a result of human activity – namely industrial production. In order to continue producing – and being able to declare that their economy is growing – humans are harvesting the natural resources of the planet – water, fossil fuels, timber, land, ore, etc – and plugging them into an industrial cycle which puts out various consumables (cars, clothes, furniture, phones, processed food etc) and a lot of waste. This process depletes the natural ability of the environment to balance itself and disrupts ecological cycles (for example deforestation leads to lower CO2 absorption by forests), while at the same time, it adds a large amount of waste (for example CO2 from burned fossil fuels). This, in turn, is leading to changes in the climate of our planet. This same process is also responsible for COVID-19 and other outbreaks. The need for more natural resources has forced humans to encroach on various natural habitats and expose themselves to yet unknown pathogens. At the same time, the growth of mass production of food has created large-scale farms, where massive numbers of livestock and poultry packed into megabarns. As socialist biologist Rob Wallace argues in his  book  Big Farms Make Big Flu, this has created the perfect environment for the mutation and emergence of new diseases such as hepatitis E, Nipah virus, Q fever, and others. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  estimates  that three out of four new infectious diseases come from human-animal contact. The outbreaks of  Ebola and other coronaviruses such as MERS , for instance, were triggered by a jump from animal to human in disturbed natural habitats. In the case of COVID-19, it is suspected that the virus was transmitted to humans at a “wet market” in the city of Wuhan, where wildlife was being sold. The mass-scale breeding of wild animals, including pangolins, civet cats, foxes, wild geese, and boar among many others is a  $74bn industry  in China and has been viewed as a get-rich-quick scheme by its rural population. The origin of the virus makes it a perfect example of how the way capitalism commodifies life to turn it into profit can directly endanger human life. In this sense, the ongoing pandemic is the product of unrestrained capitalist production and consumption patterns and is very much part of the deleterious environmental changes it is causing. The failure to contain it is also due to the capitalist drive of the global economy. In the United States, some have  claimed  that profit losses from the freezing of economic activity are not worth closing the country for business for more than 15 days. The World Bank Group has also recently stated that structural adjustment reforms will need to be implemented to recover from COVID-19, including requirements for loans being tied to doing away with “excessive regulations, subsidies, licensing regimes, trade protection…to foster markets, choice, and faster growth prospects.” Doubling down on neoliberal policies which encourage the unrestrained abuse of resources would be a catastrophic prospect in a post-COVID-19 world. The suspension of environmental laws and regulations in the US is already a frightening sign of what returning to “normal” means for the establishment.  Although both COVID-19 and climate change are rooted in the same abusive economic behaviour and both have proven to be deadly for humans, governments have seen them as separate and unconnected phenomena and have therefore responded rather differently to them. The vast majority of countries around the world – albeit with varying degrees of delay – have taken strict measures to curb the movement and gathering of people in order to contain the virus, even at the expense of economic growth. The same has not happened with climate change. Current climate change measures have taken little heed of the scale and progression of the environmental changes we are experiencing. Climate change does not follow  four-year election cycles or five-year economic plans. It does not wait for 2030 or 2050 Sustainable Development targets. Various aspects of climate change progress at different speeds and in different locations and although for some of us these changes might not be obvious or palpable, they are happening. There are also certain thresholds which if crossed will cause change to be irreversible – whether in greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere, the loss of insect populations or the melting of the  permafrost .  And while we do not get daily updates on the death toll caused by climate change, as we do with COVID-19, it is much deadlier than the virus. Global warming of 3C and 4C above pre-industrial levels  could easily  lead to a series of catastrophic outcomes. It could severely affect our ability to produce food by decreasing the fertility of soils, intensifying droughts, causing coastal inundations, increasing the loss of pollinators, etc. It could also cause severe heatwaves across the world, which have already proven increasingly deadly both in terms of high temperatures and the wildfires they cause , as well as more extreme weather phenomena like hurricanes. Pursuing the UN Sustainable Development Goals, carbon offsetting schemes, incremental eco-efficiencies, vegan diets for the wealthy and other similar tactics  will not stop  climate change because they do not discourage mass industrial production and consumption but simply shift their emphasis. Such approaches will never work because they do not entail the necessary radical change of our high-powered lives that is required to force us to slow down and reduce our emissions. The rapid response to COVID-19 around the world illustrates the remarkable capacity of society to put the emergency brake on “business-as-usual” simply by acting in the moment. It shows that we can take radical action if we want to. Lockdowns across the world have already resulted in a significant drop in greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants. In China, for instance, the lockdown caused carbon dioxide to  drop  by at least 25 percent and nitrogen dioxide by 37 percent.  Yet, this temporary decrease in greenhouse gases should not be a cause for celebration. The fact is that as a result of the lockdowns, millions of people have already lost their jobs and billions will probably struggle amid the economic downturn the outbreak is causing. While some have called for climate change to be just as drastic as the one undertaken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, it should not be. We need a just climate transition which ensures the protection of the poor and most vulnerable and which is integrated into our pandemic response. This would not only reverse the climate disaster we are already living in but also minimise the risk of new pandemics like the current one breaking out.  The just climate transition should involve economic reforms to introduce “planned degrowth” that puts the wellbeing of people over profit margins. The first step towards that is ensuring the stimulus packages that governments are announcing across the world are not wasted on bailing out corporations. We must avoid at all costs a situation where unscrupulous big businesses and state actors are allowed free reign to reinforce appalling global inequality while the rest of civil society is quarantined at home.  We should demand that government funds are instead allocated to decentralised renewable energy production in order to start implementing the Green New Deal and create new meaningful jobs amid the post- COVID-19  economic crisis. In parallel, we should ensure the provision of universal healthcare and free education, the extension of social protection for all vulnerable populations and the prioritisation of affordable housing. The current response to COVID-19 could help usher in some of these changes. It could get us accustomed to lifestyles and work patterns that minimise consumption. It could encourage us to commute and travel less, reduce household waste, have shorter work weeks, and rely more on local supply chains – i.e. actions that do not hurt the livelihoods of the working classes but shift economic activity from a globalised to a more localised pattern. Obviously, the conditions surrounding COVID-19 are not ideal, but the rapid and urgent actions in response to the virus and the inspiring examples of mutual aid also illustrate that society is more than capable of acting collectively in the face of grave danger to the whole of humanity.

Land clearance and deforestation, as well as forest fires of increasing scale and severity, meant the forests released more carbon into the air than they stored, the study by UNESCO, the World Resources Institute, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) found. Among the World Heritage forests contributing to emissions were the Sumatran rainforest, the Kinabalu Park in Malaysian Borneo, and the Blue Mountains in Australia. Yosemite and the Grand Canyon in the United States were also net emitters. “Our finding that even some of the most iconic and best protected forests, such as those found in World Heritage sites, can actually contribute to climate change is alarming and brings to light evidence of the severity of this climate emergency,” said Tales Carvalho Resende, of UNESCO and co-author of the report. The researchers used global satellite mapping with ground level monitoring to estimate the gross and net carbon absorbed and emitted by the World Heritage forests between 2001 and 2020, and to determine the causes of some of the emissions. They found that, as a whole, World Heritage forests absorbed the equivalent of approximately 190 million tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year, which is equivalent to about half the United Kingdom’s annual emissions from fossil fuels. But they also found that some sites, despite remaining net carbon sinks overall, showed spikes or clear upward trajectories in emissions that threatened the strength of the future sink. “We now have the most detailed picture to date of the vital role that forests in World Heritage sites play in mitigating climate change,” Resende said. “All forests should be assets in the fight against climate change.” There are 257 World Heritage forests across the globe, which cover a combined area of 69 million hectares (170 million acres) – roughly twice the size of Germany – and represent some of the world’s most biodiverse ecosystems. They not only absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but also store substantial amounts of carbon – approximately 13 billion tons, more than the carbon in Kuwait’s proven oil reserves, according to the report. The researchers warned continued landscape fragmentation and degradation as a result of human activity was likely to lead to more frequent and intense climate-related wildfires, and urged governments to reinforce protection and improve land management at the World Heritage sites, as well as their surrounding areas. It also recommended protection of the forests be integrated into the world’s climate strategies. “Protecting World Heritage sites from increasing fragmentation and escalating threats will be central to our collective ability to address climate change and biodiversity loss,” Tim Badman, Director of IUCN’s World Heritage Programme, said in a statement.

"New study finds human activity since 2001 has caused harm in even the world’s most protected forests. Humans and climate change have transformed 10 of the world’s most highly protected forests into net emitters of carbon over the past 20 years, according to a new report. Land clearance and deforestation, as well as forest fires of increasing scale and severity, meant the forests released more carbon into the air than they stored, the study by UNESCO, the World Resources Institute, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) found. Among the World Heritage forests contributing to emissions were the Sumatran rainforest, the Kinabalu Park in Malaysian Borneo, and the Blue Mountains in Australia. Yosemite and the Grand Canyon in the United States were also net emitters. “Our finding that even some of the most iconic and best protected forests, such as those found in World Heritage sites, can actually contribute to climate change is alarming and brings to light evidence of the severity of this climate emergency,” said Tales Carvalho Resende, of UNESCO and co-author of the report. The researchers used global satellite mapping with ground level monitoring to estimate the gross and net carbon absorbed and emitted by the World Heritage forests between 2001 and 2020, and to determine the causes of some of the emissions. They found that, as a whole, World Heritage forests absorbed the equivalent of approximately 190 million tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year, which is equivalent to about half the United Kingdom’s annual emissions from fossil fuels. But they also found that some sites, despite remaining net carbon sinks overall, showed spikes or clear upward trajectories in emissions that threatened the strength of the future sink. “We now have the most detailed picture to date of the vital role that forests in World Heritage sites play in mitigating climate change,” Resende said. “All forests should be assets in the fight against climate change.” There are 257 World Heritage forests across the globe, which cover a combined area of 69 million hectares (170 million acres) – roughly twice the size of Germany – and represent some of the world’s most biodiverse ecosystems. They not only absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but also store substantial amounts of carbon – approximately 13 billion tons, more than the carbon in Kuwait’s proven oil reserves, according to the report.

"Fossil fuel companies lied for decades about climate change, and humanity is paying the price. Shouldn’t those lies be central to the public narrative? Every person on Earth today is living in a crime scene. This crime has been going on for decades. We see its effects in the horrific heat and wildfires unfolding this summer in the American West; in the megastorms that were so numerous in 2020 that scientists ran out of names for them; in the global projections that sea levels are set to rise by at least 20 feet (6 metres). Our only hope is to slow this inexorable ascent so our children may figure out some way to cope. This crime has displaced or killed untold numbers of people around the world, caused billions of dollars in economic damage and ravaged vital ecosystems and wildlife. It has disproportionately affected already marginalised communities around the world, from farmers in coastal Bangladesh, where the fast-rising seas are salting the soil and slashing rice yields, to low-income residents of Houston, Chicago and other cities, whose neighbourhoods suffer higher temperatures than prosperous areas across town. This crime threatens today’s young people most of all and calls into question the very survival of the human civilisation. And yet, the criminals responsible for this devastation are still at large. Indeed, they continue to perpetrate their crime, and even make money from it, not least because their crime remains unknown to most of the public. This is enough to make your blood boil, especially if you are a parent. My daughter just turned 16, and I have been thinking about the safest place she can spend her adult life since she was a baby and I first started writing about adapting to climate change. The orange skies blanketing her hometown of San Francisco after last summer’s record wildfires were a heartbreaking, infuriating sign that California will not be that safe haven. The crime in question is the fossil fuel industry’s 40 years of lying about climate change. Arguably the most consequential corporate deception in history, the industry’s lies have had the effect of blunting public awareness and governmental action against what scientists say is now a full-fledged climate emergency. As a candidate in the 2020 US presidential elections, Joe Biden said he would support efforts to prosecute the oil giants for their lies. It remains to be seen whether he will keep that promise. Journalists have dedicated years to documenting the crime scene evidence. In 2015, an investigation by the Columbia Journalism School and the Los Angeles Times blew the case open by tracing the crime link to ExxonMobil, then the world’s largest oil company. Internal records showed that by the late 1970s, Exxon’s own scientists were briefing its top executives that man-made global warming was real, potentially catastrophic, and caused mainly by burning fossil fuels. Climate activists seized on the revelations, launching the hashtag #ExxonKnew. Further investigations found that Chevron, Shell, and other oil giants likewise knew that their products threatened to render the earth’s climate uninhabitable. In short, it was not just Exxon that knew. They all knew. And they all chose to lie about it. Beginning in the 1990s, oil companies spent millions upon millions of dollars on public relations campaigns to confuse the press, the public, and policymakers about the dangers posed by burning fossil fuels. Their aim was “to reposition global warming as theory, not fact”, one planning document stated. Front groups and friendly politicians spread the companies’ lies. News outlets, especially in the United States, swallowed and regurgitated those lies to an unsuspecting public. Humanity ultimately wasted precious decades arguing about whether global warming was real rather than defusing the threat. Instead of launching a transition to renewable energy, the consumption of fossil fuels increased. More than half of the total greenhouse gases now overheating the planet were emitted after 1990 – after Exxon and other fossil fuel giants privately knew what havoc they were seeding. Exxon “could have ended the pretend debate over climate change as early as the 1980s”, author and activist Bill McKibben later wrote. “When scientists like NASA’s Jim Hansen first raised public awareness of climate change [in 1988], think of what would have happened if Exxon’s chief executive had gone to Congress, too, and said that their internal scientific efforts show[ed] precisely the same thing.” While pockets of the American public may already know about big oil’s crime, the vast majority of its victims almost certainly do not. How could they? Big Oil’s record of lying never became part of the public narrative about climate change, largely because most news outlets did not incorporate it into their continuing coverage of climate change. The initial “Exxon knew” revelations in 2015 received relatively little follow-up coverage beyond the outlets that published them. Television, which even in the internet era remains the primary source of news for most people, ignored the revelations entirely. There were a few stories in the business press and independent media, especially years later when New York state and other local governments began suing oil companies for damages. But the media as a whole seems to have forgotten that Big Oil’s climate lies ever happened. It is long past time to right these wrongs. To date, the oil companies, the executives in charge of them, the propagandists they have employed and the politicians they have funded have largely escaped blame, much less had to pay – whether through financial penalties or prison time – for the immense damage they have done. News outlets also owe the public an apology for mishandling this story, along with a commitment to doing much sharper coverage in the future. Humanity cannot get back the 40 years lost to Big Oil’s climate lies. It is now beyond urgent that rich and poor countries alike quit fossil fuels in favour of renewable energy and other climate-smart practices. Equally crucial is that we fortify our communities against the fearsome climate impacts that, because of our decades of delay, can no longer be avoided. All this will cost money – lots of it. The world’s governments will be arguing from now through the make-or-break UN climate summit in November about who pays how much. Restoring Big Oil’s lies to their rightful place at the heart of the climate story would offer an answer to that riddle, one that Biden should be pressed on: Big Oil knew – shouldn’t Big Oil pay?

"Fossil fuel companies lied for decades about climate change, and humanity is paying the price. Shouldn’t those lies be central to the public narrative? Every person on Earth today is living in a crime scene. This crime has been going on for decades. We see its effects in the horrific heat and wildfires unfolding this summer in the American West; in the megastorms that were so numerous in 2020 that scientists ran out of names for them; in the global projections that sea levels are set to rise by at least 20 feet (6 metres). Our only hope is to slow this inexorable ascent so our children may figure out some way to cope. This crime has displaced or killed untold numbers of people around the world, caused billions of dollars in economic damage and ravaged vital ecosystems and wildlife. It has disproportionately affected already marginalised communities around the world, from farmers in coastal Bangladesh, where the fast-rising seas are salting the soil and slashing rice yields, to low-income residents of Houston, Chicago and other cities, whose neighbourhoods suffer higher temperatures than prosperous areas across town. This crime threatens today’s young people most of all and calls into question the very survival of the human civilisation. And yet, the criminals responsible for this devastation are still at large. Indeed, they continue to perpetrate their crime, and even make money from it, not least because their crime remains unknown to most of the public. This is enough to make your blood boil, especially if you are a parent. My daughter just turned 16, and I have been thinking about the safest place she can spend her adult life since she was a baby and I first started writing about adapting to climate change. The orange skies blanketing her hometown of San Francisco after last summer’s record wildfires were a heartbreaking, infuriating sign that California will not be that safe haven. The crime in question is the fossil fuel industry’s 40 years of lying about climate change. Arguably the most consequential corporate deception in history, the industry’s lies have had the effect of blunting public awareness and governmental action against what scientists say is now a full-fledged climate emergency. As a candidate in the 2020 US presidential elections, Joe Biden said he would support efforts to prosecute the oil giants for their lies. It remains to be seen whether he will keep that promise. Journalists have dedicated years to documenting the crime scene evidence. In 2015, an investigation by the Columbia Journalism School and the Los Angeles Times blew the case open by tracing the crime link to ExxonMobil, then the world’s largest oil company. Internal records showed that by the late 1970s, Exxon’s own scientists were briefing its top executives that man-made global warming was real, potentially catastrophic, and caused mainly by burning fossil fuels. Climate activists seized on the revelations, launching the hashtag #ExxonKnew. Further investigations found that Chevron, Shell, and other oil giants likewise knew that their products threatened to render the earth’s climate uninhabitable. In short, it was not just Exxon that knew. They all knew. And they all chose to lie about it. Beginning in the 1990s, oil companies spent millions upon millions of dollars on public relations campaigns to confuse the press, the public, and policymakers about the dangers posed by burning fossil fuels. Their aim was “to reposition global warming as theory, not fact”, one planning document stated. Front groups and friendly politicians spread the companies’ lies. News outlets, especially in the United States, swallowed and regurgitated those lies to an unsuspecting public. Humanity ultimately wasted precious decades arguing about whether global warming was real rather than defusing the threat. Instead of launching a transition to renewable energy, the consumption of fossil fuels increased. More than half of the total greenhouse gases now overheating the planet were emitted after 1990 – after Exxon and other fossil fuel giants privately knew what havoc they were seeding. Exxon “could have ended the pretend debate over climate change as early as the 1980s”, author and activist Bill McKibben later wrote. “When scientists like NASA’s Jim Hansen first raised public awareness of climate change [in 1988], think of what would have happened if Exxon’s chief executive had gone to Congress, too, and said that their internal scientific efforts show[ed] precisely the same thing.” While pockets of the American public may already know about big oil’s crime, the vast majority of its victims almost certainly do not. How could they? Big Oil’s record of lying never became part of the public narrative about climate change, largely because most news outlets did not incorporate it into their continuing coverage of climate change. The initial “Exxon knew” revelations in 2015 received relatively little follow-up coverage beyond the outlets that published them. Television, which even in the internet era remains the primary source of news for most people, ignored the revelations entirely. There were a few stories in the business press and independent media, especially years later when New York state and other local governments began suing oil companies for damages. But the media as a whole seems to have forgotten that Big Oil’s climate lies ever happened. It is long past time to right these wrongs. To date, the oil companies, the executives in charge of them, the propagandists they have employed and the politicians they have funded have largely escaped blame, much less had to pay – whether through financial penalties or prison time – for the immense damage they have done. News outlets also owe the public an apology for mishandling this story, along with a commitment to doing much sharper coverage in the future. Humanity cannot get back the 40 years lost to Big Oil’s climate lies. It is now beyond urgent that rich and poor countries alike quit fossil fuels in favour of renewable energy and other climate-smart practices. Equally crucial is that we fortify our communities against the fearsome climate impacts that, because of our decades of delay, can no longer be avoided. All this will cost money – lots of it. The world’s governments will be arguing from now through the make-or-break UN climate summit in November about who pays how much. Restoring Big Oil’s lies to their rightful place at the heart of the climate story would offer an answer to that riddle, one that Biden should be pressed on: Big Oil knew – shouldn’t Big Oil pay?

In 2015, an investigation by the Columbia Journalism School and the Los Angeles Times blew the case open by tracing the crime link to ExxonMobil, then the world’s largest oil company. Internal records showed that by the late 1970s, Exxon’s own scientists were briefing its top executives that man-made global warming was real, potentially catastrophic, and caused mainly by burning fossil fuels. Climate activists seized on the revelations, launching the hashtag #ExxonKnew. Further investigations found that Chevron, Shell, and other oil giants likewise knew that their products threatened to render the earth’s climate uninhabitable. In short, it was not just Exxon that knew. They all knew. And they all chose to lie about it. Beginning in the 1990s, oil companies spent millions upon millions of dollars on public relations campaigns to confuse the press, the public, and policymakers about the dangers posed by burning fossil fuels. Their aim was “to reposition global warming as theory, not fact”, one planning document stated. Front groups and friendly politicians spread the companies’ lies. News outlets, especially in the United States, swallowed and regurgitated those lies to an unsuspecting public. Humanity ultimately wasted precious decades arguing about whether global warming was real rather than defusing the threat. Instead of launching a transition to renewable energy, the consumption of fossil fuels increased. More than half of the total greenhouse gases now overheating the planet were emitted after 1990 – after Exxon and other fossil fuel giants privately knew what havoc they were seeding. Exxon “could have ended the pretend debate over climate change as early as the 1980s”, author and activist Bill McKibben later wrote. “When scientists like NASA’s Jim Hansen first raised public awareness of climate change [in 1988], think of what would have happened if Exxon’s chief executive had gone to Congress, too, and said that their internal scientific efforts show[ed] precisely the same thing.” While pockets of the American public may already know about big oil’s crime, the vast majority of its victims almost certainly do not. How could they? Big Oil’s record of lying never became part of the public narrative about climate change, largely because most news outlets did not incorporate it into their continuing coverage of climate change. The initial “Exxon knew” revelations in 2015 received relatively little follow-up coverage beyond the outlets that published them. Television, which even in the internet era remains the primary source of news for most people, ignored the revelations entirely. There were a few stories in the business press and independent media, especially years later when New York state and other local governments began suing oil companies for damages. But the media as a whole seems to have forgotten that Big Oil’s climate lies ever happened. It is long past time to right these wrongs. To date, the oil companies, the executives in charge of them, the propagandists they have employed and the politicians they have funded have largely escaped blame, much less had to pay – whether through financial penalties or prison time – for the immense damage they have done. News outlets also owe the public an apology for mishandling this story, along with a commitment to doing much sharper coverage in the future. Humanity cannot get back the 40 years lost to Big Oil’s climate lies. It is now beyond urgent that rich and poor countries alike quit fossil fuels in favour of renewable energy and other climate-smart practices. Equally crucial is that we fortify our communities against the fearsome climate impacts that, because of our decades of delay, can no longer be avoided. All this will cost money – lots of it. The world’s governments will be arguing from now through the make-or-break UN climate summit in November about who pays how much. Restoring Big Oil’s lies to their rightful place at the heart of the climate story would offer an answer to that riddle, one that Biden should be pressed on: Big Oil knew – shouldn’t Big Oil pay?

"Fossil fuel companies lied for decades about climate change, and humanity is paying the price. Shouldn’t those lies be central to the public narrative? Every person on Earth today is living in a crime scene. This crime has been going on for decades. We see its effects in the horrific heat and wildfires unfolding this summer in the American West; in the megastorms that were so numerous in 2020 that scientists ran out of names for them; in the global projections that sea levels are set to rise by at least 20 feet (6 metres). Our only hope is to slow this inexorable ascent so our children may figure out some way to cope. This crime has displaced or killed untold numbers of people around the world, caused billions of dollars in economic damage and ravaged vital ecosystems and wildlife. It has disproportionately affected already marginalised communities around the world, from farmers in coastal Bangladesh, where the fast-rising seas are salting the soil and slashing rice yields, to low-income residents of Houston, Chicago and other cities, whose neighbourhoods suffer higher temperatures than prosperous areas across town. This crime threatens today’s young people most of all and calls into question the very survival of the human civilisation. And yet, the criminals responsible for this devastation are still at large. Indeed, they continue to perpetrate their crime, and even make money from it, not least because their crime remains unknown to most of the public. This is enough to make your blood boil, especially if you are a parent. My daughter just turned 16, and I have been thinking about the safest place she can spend her adult life since she was a baby and I first started writing about adapting to climate change. The orange skies blanketing her hometown of San Francisco after last summer’s record wildfires were a heartbreaking, infuriating sign that California will not be that safe haven. The crime in question is the fossil fuel industry’s 40 years of lying about climate change. Arguably the most consequential corporate deception in history, the industry’s lies have had the effect of blunting public awareness and governmental action against what scientists say is now a full-fledged climate emergency.

"Climate talks known as COP27 in Egypt in November ‘must be the place for serious action on loss and damage’, UN chief says. The UN General Assembly passed a resolution on Friday for better access to international financing to help developing nations mitigate and adapt to increasingly calamitous climate change. Rich countries’ unkept promise to provide $100bn a year in climate change financing starting in 2020 is a recurring sticking point in international talks on the climate emergency. So is a call from developing countries for a fund specifically designed to compensate for their “ loss and damage ” already suffered because of global warming largely caused by industrialised nations. In a speech to the General Assembly, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said UN climate talks known as COP27 opening in Egypt in November “must be the place for serious action on loss and damage”. “COP27 must be the place for clarity on vital funding for adaptation and resilience,” Guterres said. At last year’s COP26 conference in Glasgow, developed nations promised to double climate adaptation support to $40bn a year by 2025. However, $300bn a year will be needed by developing countries for adaptation by 2030, according to the UN. 		 					 
				 		 Developing countries are the least responsible for climate change but the ones who suffer the most because of it. Such is the case with the government of Pakistan where recent flooding killed some 1,700, destroyed or damaged two million homes, and left one-third of the country submerged. Addressing this calamity, the UN General Assembly called on the international community to boost humanitarian assistance to and rehabilitation of Pakistan. Guterres said he is working with the government of Pakistan to organise a high-level donors conference. “For so many with so little, the effects of these floods will be felt not just for days or even months,” he said, adding this disaster is just a taste of what is to come. “Climate chaos is knocking on everyone’s door, right now,” said Guterres. Germany wants the question of loss and damage from global warming to be discussed at this year’s UN climate talks, Germany’s foreign minister said on Friday. Vulnerable countries have long demanded that big polluters be held accountable for the effects that their greenhouse gas emissions are having around the world, including the tangible destruction caused by extreme weather and sea level rise resulting from rising global temperatures. But rich nations that account for the majority of planet-warming emissions since the start of the industrial era have largely opposed efforts to formally debate the “loss and damage” issue for fear they might have to pay climate reparations. Speaking after a meeting with her counterpart from Pakistan, German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said the recent devastating floods in the South Asian nation had shown “what dramatic consequences the climate crisis is having in all regions”. “As one of the hardest-hit countries worldwide, Pakistan is paying a high price for global CO2 emissions,” Baerbock, a member of the environmentalist Greens party, told reporters in Berlin. “That’s why Germany will work toward a fair sharing of the costs at the COP27 in Egypt, putting the question of climate adaptation – but in particular, also the question of loss and damage – on the agenda,” she said, referring to the UN climate talks next month in Sharm el-Sheikh. Caribbean nations, too, will unite to seek loss and damage compensation for the impact of climate change at COP27. Small island states are among the most affected by rising temperatures.

But rich nations that account for the majority of planet-warming emissions since the start of the industrial era have largely opposed efforts to formally debate the “loss and damage” issue for fear they might have to pay climate reparations. Speaking after a meeting with her counterpart from Pakistan, German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said the recent devastating floods in the South Asian nation had shown “what dramatic consequences the climate crisis is having in all regions”. “As one of the hardest-hit countries worldwide, Pakistan is paying a high price for global CO2 emissions,” Baerbock, a member of the environmentalist Greens party, told reporters in Berlin. “That’s why Germany will work toward a fair sharing of the costs at the COP27 in Egypt, putting the question of climate adaptation – but in particular, also the question of loss and damage – on the agenda,” she said, referring to the UN climate talks next month in Sharm el-Sheikh. Caribbean nations, too, will unite to seek loss and damage compensation for the impact of climate change at COP27. Small island states are among the most affected by rising temperatures. Caribbean leaders also highlighted the importance of tourism to regional economies and “the increasingly devastating impact climate change has on that industry”.

"Looking back on the last five years of UN climate talks, many fear a Trump re-election will halt efforts to end global warming. In just two days, millions of American voters will head to the polls to decide where the United States stands on the fight against climate change. While presidential candidate Joe Biden has declared climate change the “number one issue facing humanity” and announced a $2-trillion clean energy plan to tackle the crisis, many worry that another four years under President Donald Trump – who has repeatedly denied climate science and shunned global climate efforts – will sound a death knell for the environment. Ahead of the US elections, we take a look at the last five years of United Nations climate talks, and what is at stake for the health of the planet. Donald Trump, who had called global warming a hoax, has just been elected president of the United States. Shock, scorn and disbelief echo around the halls of the United Nations climate conference in Marrakesh. Some younger activists are even in tears. “My heart is absolutely broken at the election of Trump,” Becky Chung, a delegate for youth advocacy group SustainUs from California, tells a journalist . She goes on to correctly predict: “We will see a rising up of people’s movements committed to keeping fossil fuels in the ground.” Trump has pulled out of the Paris Agreement and is ripping apart Obama-era environmental regulations. But at this year’s conference, there is defiance in the air. A growing coalition of US states, cities and organisations called We Are Still In set up camp, even as Trump is determinedly walking away from the fight against the climate crisis. I interviewed Todd Stern, Obama’s chief climate negotiator. He told me the Trump presidency would be a blip, a set-back for sure, but temporary. The sentiment was that the world would march on in the fight against climate change with or without Trump. White House representatives arrive at this year’s climate talks to promote coal and other fossil fuels. They are obviously out of step with the mood, as an important group of investors managing $32 trillion in assets call for an end to coal as a source of energy. Greta Thunberg, the 15-year-old climate activist, takes the stage to castigate world leaders for their lack of concerted action. Naturalist Sir David Attenborough speaks at the opening ceremony and says climate change is humanity’s greatest threat for thousands of years. Trump, meanwhile, continues his term rollback of auto emissions standards, opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, and rejecting stronger air pollution standards. The 2020 conference is cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is now set to take place in November 2021. Record temperatures and ongoing wildfires from California to Brazil – plus hurricanes and cyclones, floods and landslides, and ongoing ice melt – continually demonstrate the urgency for action. Yet across the world, there is a sense we could be on the brink of a substantial change in the way we live, as renewables kick in and the pressure builds on fossil fuel usage. But the outcome of the US election is critical. Columbia University’s Sabin Centre for Climate Change Law counted 159 actions “to scale back or wholly eliminate climate mitigation and adaptation measures” since Trump took office. The words “climate change” have also been eliminated from government reports, while other reports have been buried. A month ago, Trump said it will soon start getting cooler while dismissing the expertise of climate scientists. While our world is burning, the US president is denying science at every opportunity. And on November 4, the day after the election, the US will exit the Paris climate agreement, a global pact that has wobbled but not yet collapsed. Democratic nominee Joe Biden meanwhile has promised to immediately rejoin the Paris deal should he win and has unveiled a $2 trillion clean economy job programme. He has a long way to go to get the US on course towards a zero-carbon future, but as the former Obama adviser on climate policy, John Podesta, said : “It would be pretty much game over for the international system if [Donal Trump is] re-elected … We’d miss the chance to avoid warming at a catastrophic level.” The world holds its breath. 1. La Nina weather event: A “moderate to strong” La Nina event is developing in the Pacific Ocean, the World Meteorological Organization said . The phenomenon causes ocean surface temperatures to cool. Despite this, experts say it will not change the fact that 2020 will be one of the warmest years on record. 2. US’s “oldest city” threatened by floods: St Augustine, Florida – which was founded in 1565 by Spanish explorers – is under threat from severely rising sea levels. While climate change is not the direct cause, it is increasing the severity and frequency of flooding events. 3.

"Looking back on the last five years of UN climate talks, many fear a Trump re-election will halt efforts to end global warming. In just two days, millions of American voters will head to the polls to decide where the United States stands on the fight against climate change. While presidential candidate Joe Biden has declared climate change the “number one issue facing humanity” and announced a $2-trillion clean energy plan to tackle the crisis, many worry that another four years under President Donald Trump – who has repeatedly denied climate science and shunned global climate efforts – will sound a death knell for the environment. Ahead of the US elections, we take a look at the last five years of United Nations climate talks, and what is at stake for the health of the planet. Donald Trump, who had called global warming a hoax, has just been elected president of the United States. Shock, scorn and disbelief echo around the halls of the United Nations climate conference in Marrakesh. Some younger activists are even in tears. “My heart is absolutely broken at the election of Trump,” Becky Chung, a delegate for youth advocacy group SustainUs from California, tells a journalist . She goes on to correctly predict: “We will see a rising up of people’s movements committed to keeping fossil fuels in the ground.” Trump has pulled out of the Paris Agreement and is ripping apart Obama-era environmental regulations. But at this year’s conference, there is defiance in the air. A growing coalition of US states, cities and organisations called We Are Still In set up camp, even as Trump is determinedly walking away from the fight against the climate crisis. I interviewed Todd Stern, Obama’s chief climate negotiator. He told me the Trump presidency would be a blip, a set-back for sure, but temporary. The sentiment was that the world would march on in the fight against climate change with or without Trump. White House representatives arrive at this year’s climate talks to promote coal and other fossil fuels. They are obviously out of step with the mood, as an important group of investors managing $32 trillion in assets call for an end to coal as a source of energy. Greta Thunberg, the 15-year-old climate activist, takes the stage to castigate world leaders for their lack of concerted action. Naturalist Sir David Attenborough speaks at the opening ceremony and says climate change is humanity’s greatest threat for thousands of years. Trump, meanwhile, continues his term rollback of auto emissions standards, opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, and rejecting stronger air pollution standards. The 2020 conference is cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is now set to take place in November 2021. Record temperatures and ongoing wildfires from California to Brazil – plus hurricanes and cyclones, floods and landslides, and ongoing ice melt – continually demonstrate the urgency for action. Yet across the world, there is a sense we could be on the brink of a substantial change in the way we live, as renewables kick in and the pressure builds on fossil fuel usage. But the outcome of the US election is critical. Columbia University’s Sabin Centre for Climate Change Law counted 159 actions “to scale back or wholly eliminate climate mitigation and adaptation measures” since Trump took office. The words “climate change” have also been eliminated from government reports, while other reports have been buried. A month ago, Trump said it will soon start getting cooler while dismissing the expertise of climate scientists. While our world is burning, the US president is denying science at every opportunity. And on November 4, the day after the election, the US will exit the Paris climate agreement, a global pact that has wobbled but not yet collapsed. Democratic nominee Joe Biden meanwhile has promised to immediately rejoin the Paris deal should he win and has unveiled a $2 trillion clean economy job programme. He has a long way to go to get the US on course towards a zero-carbon future, but as the former Obama adviser on climate policy, John Podesta, said : “It would be pretty much game over for the international system if [Donal Trump is] re-elected … We’d miss the chance to avoid warming at a catastrophic level.” The world holds its breath. 1.

"The last Group of 20 (G20) nation to do so, Turkey had not ratified the landmark agreement for five years, arguing it should not be considered a developed country. Turkey ratified the Paris climate accord on Wednesday, joining the global fight against climate change weeks before the start of a critical summit in Glasgow, Scotland. Though Turkey was among the first countries to sign the Paris Agreement in 2016 , it held off ratifying it as it sought to be reclassified as a developing instead of developed country to avoid harsher emission reduction targets and benefit from financial support. It was among six countries — including Iran, Iraq, Eritrea, Libya and Yemen — to not ratify it. On Wednesday, 353 members of Turkey’s parliament ratified the agreement unanimously. Announcing that Turkey would ratify the deal at the United Nations General Assembly last month, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said countries that have a “historical responsibility” for climate change should make the most effort. “Whoever made the most damage to nature, our air, our water, our soil, the Earth; whoever savagely exploited natural resources needs to make the largest contribution to the fight against climate change,” he said. The United Nations welcomed Turkey’s move. “It’s essential that all countries continue to boost ambition, and the secretary-general has been clear that G20 countries must lead the way,” Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for UN chief Antonio Guterres, told Anadolu news agency. Turkey has felt the full force of climate change with a rapid succession of floods and wildfires killing some 100 people in July and August. Swathes of the country have also been suffering through an extended drought. Climate experts have warned the Mediterranean basin, which includes Turkey, faces the risk of severe drought and desertification. The Paris Agreement’s stated goal is to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) — preferably to 1.5C — compared to pre-industrial levels. The world has already warmed 1.2C (3.2F) since that time. Under the agreement, nations are expected to set greenhouse gas emission-reducing actions depending on their economic status. Some 95 percent of young people in Turkey believe climate change is one of the biggest threats facing the country, according to a report last month by the British Council, which was part of its Global Youth Letter on Climate Action. 		 					 
				 		 Before Turkey’s ratification, the Climate Action Tracker project said Ankara’s efforts to reach the Paris accord’s goals were “critically insufficient”. Nearly 200,000 hectares (494,000 acres) of forest have been scorched in Turkey this year — more than five times the annual average from 2008 to 2020, according to data from the European Forest Fire Information System. Turkey’s intended nationally determined contribution was a reduction of 21 percent by 2030 from a projected emission of 1,175 million tonnes to 929 million tonnes. In 2012, total CO2 emissions in Turkey were 440 million tonnes, with the energy sector releasing 70.2 percent of those emissions. Ankara has said Turkey’s greenhouse gas emissions are lower than European Union and OECD averages and is responsible for 0.7 percent of global emissions. It has also said the country has financial and technological constraints in combating climate change, and wants access to funds and technology to reach targets. Turkey relies on imported fuel and natural gas along with coal-burning and hydroelectric power plants for its energy needs. However, it has ample opportunities to tap renewable energy resources, environmental groups say. In July, wildfires devastated swathes of forest land along Turkey’s southern coast, killing eight people and forcing thousands to flee. As firefighters continued to battle blazes, parts of the country’s northern Black Sea coast were hit by floods that killed 82 people. Earlier this year, a layer of sea mucilage covered the Sea of Marmara, threatening marine life. Meanwhile, hundreds of infant and mature flamingoes were found dead at the drought-hit Tuz Lake, a breeding spot for the birds. The government has acknowledged climate change is a leading reason for these disasters, but has done little to protect the environment, allowing deforestation for infrastructure and mining while pushing for urbanisation across the country.

Turkey’s intended nationally determined contribution was a reduction of 21 percent by 2030 from a projected emission of 1,175 million tonnes to 929 million tonnes. In 2012, total CO2 emissions in Turkey were 440 million tonnes, with the energy sector releasing 70.2 percent of those emissions. Ankara has said Turkey’s greenhouse gas emissions are lower than European Union and OECD averages and is responsible for 0.7 percent of global emissions. It has also said the country has financial and technological constraints in combating climate change, and wants access to funds and technology to reach targets. Turkey relies on imported fuel and natural gas along with coal-burning and hydroelectric power plants for its energy needs.

"Devastating climate effects from unliveable heat to more widespread disease are accelerating and will become obvious within 30 years, draft UN report says. A leaked draft report from the United Nations has painted a distressing picture of how climate change will fundamentally reshape life on Earth in the coming decades, even if humans can tame planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. In what is by far considered the most comprehensive catalogue ever assembled of how climate change is upending the world, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) drafted a 4,000-page document that was seen by AFP news agency on Wednesday. Species extinction, more widespread disease, unliveable heat, ecosystem collapse, cities menaced by rising seas – these and other devastating climate effects are accelerating and are bound to become painfully obvious before a child born today turns 30, according to the draft report. “The worst is yet to come, affecting our children’s and grandchildren’s lives much more than our own,” the draft report says. But the document, designed to influence critical policy decisions, is not scheduled for release until February 2022 – too late for crunch UN summits this year on climate, biodiversity and food systems, some scientists say. The report warns that previous major climate shocks dramatically altered the environment and wiped out most species, raising the question of whether humanity is sowing the seeds of its own demise. “Life on Earth can recover from a drastic climate shift by evolving into new species and creating new ecosystems,” it says. “Humans cannot.” The IPCC released a statement on Wednesday saying it “does not comment on the contents of draft reports while work is still ongoing”. Respected climate scientist Francois Gemenne, who leads the Hugo Observatory and is an author on the IPPC report, stressed that the draft seen by AFP will undergo revisions before it is finalised and may even include extra sections. “This is not the version that will be adopted in February 2022,” he said on Twitter. He added that it would be a “serious mistake” to imagine that any focus on the “key messages” was useful. “Disclosure of results prior to the outcome of this process undermines the credibility of the work of the IPCC as a whole,” Gemenne said. There are at least four main takeaways in the draft report, which may be subject to minor changes in the coming months as the IPCC shifts its focus to a key executive summary for policymakers. The first is that with 1.1 degrees Celsius of warming clocked so far, the climate is already changing. A decade ago, scientists believed that limiting global warming to two degrees Celsius above mid-19th century levels would be enough to safeguard our future. That goal is enshrined in the 2015 Paris Agreement, adopted by nearly 200 nations which pledged to collectively cap warming at “well below” two degrees Celsius – and 1.5 degrees if possible. Current trends suggest a three degrees Celsius rise at least. Earlier models predicted Earth-altering climate change would not be seen before 2100. But the UN draft report says that prolonged warming even beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius could produce “progressively serious, centuries’ long and, in some cases, irreversible consequences”. Last month, the World Meteorological Organization projected a 40 percent chance that Earth will cross the 1.5-degree threshold for at least one year by 2026. For some plants and animals, it could be too late: “Even at 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, conditions will change beyond many organisms’ ability to adapt,” the report notes. Coral reefs – ecosystems on which half a billion people depend – are one example. Indigenous populations in the Arctic face cultural extinction as the environment upon which their livelihoods and history are built continues to melt. A warming world has also increased the length of fire seasons, doubled potential burnable areas, and contributed to food systems losses. Jennifer Francis, senior scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center, told Al Jazeera that the effect of global warming will be felt at the individual level as well as on a global scale. “Places that are warm and humid are where we are going to see the most impact on human life, because when you combine humidity with high temperature it means that your body cannot get rid of the heat that it generates as part of its normal operation,” said Francis. “And if that combination gets too high that is when we see people succumbing to heat waves,” she added. Francis said that while North America, Europe and the Middle East are already experiencing dangerous heat waves, they could extend to the north as well, noting that Siberia recorded a temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) last summer for the first time. 		 					 
				 		 The second crucial takeaway of the draft report is that the world must face up to the reality of the changing climate and prepare for the onslaught. “Current levels of adaptation will be inadequate to respond to future climate risks,” it cautions. Mid-century projections – even under an optimistic scenario of two degrees Celsius of warming – make this an understatement. Tens of millions more people are likely to face chronic hunger by 2050, and 130 million more could experience extreme poverty within a decade if inequality is allowed to deepen. In 2050, coastal cities on the “front line” of the climate crisis will see hundreds of millions of people at risk from floods and increasingly frequent storm surges made more deadly by rising seas. Some 350 million more people living in urban areas will be exposed to water scarcity from severe droughts at 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming – 410 million at two degrees Celsius. That extra half-a-degree will also mean 420 million more people exposed to extreme and potentially lethal heatwaves. “Adaptation costs for Africa are projected to increase by tens of billions of dollars per year with warming greater than two degrees,” the report cautions. 		 					 
				 		 There is very little good news in the report, but the IPCC stresses that much can be done to avoid worst-case scenarios and prepare for effects that can no longer be averted, the final takeaway. Conservation and restoration of so-called blue carbon ecosystems – kelp and mangrove forests, for example – enhance carbon stocks and protect against storm surges, as well as providing wildlife habitats, coastal livelihoods and food security Transitioning to more plant-based diets could also reduce food-related emissions by as much as 70 percent by 2050. But simply swapping a gas guzzler for a Tesla or planting billions of trees to offset business-as-usual is not going to cut it, the report warns. “We need transformational change operating on processes and behaviours at all levels: individual, communities, business, institutions and governments,” it says. “We must redefine our way of life and consumption.” Commenting on the report, Swedish activist Greta Thunberg who spearheaded the “Fridays for Future” movement and youth climate strikes that swept the world, said the “eye-opening” report was preferable to false reassurances. But she added that she found it hopeful that “many people are becoming more and more ready to tell it like it is. “We can of course not face this crisis unless… we are adult enough to tell the truth, and to face the reality,” the 18-year-old said.

"Adapting Africa’s agriculture to withstand the impact of climate change requires significant investment. From making jam with cactus fruit, to reviving traditional underground canals to defend against drought, Morocco has a leading role in the fight against climate change in Africa ( PDF ). One of its long-standing goals has been transforming agriculture to become more sustainable. This vital sector, which contributes almost a fifth of the country’s gross domestic product, was the inspiration for the Green Morocco Plan, launched in 2008, to modernise agriculture and make it more productive and efficient. And that need remains as urgent as ever with the rising impact of global warming. Climate-related challenges in agriculture are also common to many of Morocco’s African neighbours. Yet the biggest factor that continues to link experiences across the continent is a lack of investment to adapt and meet the growing demand for food in the face of rising temperatures. 					 
				 		 This is why the Moroccan presidency of this year’s COP climate summit has made African agriculture one of its priorities when addressing climate change. For the first time, pan-African experts and officials meet to discuss their best solutions while making a united plea for $30bn to put them into action. Such regional action has become critical, as talks to include agriculture in the climate negotiations have once again failed, and will now be postponed until May 2017. In contrast to this lack of action on a global scale, we have seen at COP22 that there is no shortage of willingness to confront climate change in Africa. Every single African country has included adapting agriculture as part of their climate change strategies submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). What is missing is sufficient investment. 
				We have the plans, the strategies, the shared knowledge and the examples of best practice. What we really need now is funding to bring solutions such as these to scale.			 
				 by   			 Out of the 10 countries most affected by greenhouse gas emissions, six of them are in Africa, yet the continent only receives 5 percent of dedicated climate funding. And without investment, we cannot move forward. In Morocco, only 18 percent of farmers have access to bank loans, hampering their ability to invest in better, more sustainable methods. The cost of adapting agriculture to cope with the effects of climate change will cost between $20bn and $30bn a year until 2030, according to the African Development Bank. At COP, the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) is joining forces with the Moroccan government and partners, to suggest that there are three key areas for investment that will help safeguard African agriculture in the face of climate change. The first is better soil management. Up to 65 percent of soils in Africa are estimated to be degraded. Planting legumes such as faba bean, chickpeas and lentils that naturally fix nitrogen to the soil reducing the need for fertiliser, is an important approach to reversing this trend. OPINION: The Muslim world has to take climate action The production of legumes has been hit hard in Morocco in recent years, due to labour shortages and plant diseases. Improved varieties of chickpeas and lentils have been tested that will not only improve soil health but are resistant to diseases and suitable for harvest with a machine. These lines have been well received by farmers and could now go into national breeding programmes in Morocco and beyond. The second area is water control. A third of areas growing olives in Morocco are still using traditional flood irrigation methods, consuming water levels that are far beyond what the trees actually require. ICARDA has been working with the Moroccan government to encourage the uptake of drip irrigation, which applies less water at the base of the tree only. Farmers can receive between 80-100 percent of the funds to install drip irrigation equipment, which can reduce water consumption by up to 70 percent. Conservation agriculture is another important option to conserve soil-water content, particularly for rain-fed farming which is predominant in Morocco. OPINION: Beans – A mighty tool in the fight for food security Locally manufactured seeders have made it possible for smallholder farmers to use zero-tillage technology at an affordable price. This technological package has great potential to expand if investments are made available. The third aspect is climate-risk management. In Morocco, we have happily re-housed part of the ICARDA gene bank since we evacuated Aleppo in Syria in July 2012. This important resource stores genetic material to help breeders develop drought and climate-tolerant and disease-resilient crops, limiting future risk to food supplies. 					 
				 		 Bringing the collection of wheat, barley, chickpea, lentil and faba bean samples to Morocco puts them within easy reach of seed scientists, breeders and farmers, where they can be most effective. So we have the plans, the strategies, the shared knowledge and the examples of best practice. What we really need now is funding to bring solutions such as these to scale. Adaptation projects currently account for just 20 percent of climate public funds but need at least 50 percent in order to strike a balance with efforts that seek to mitigate the effects of climate change ( PDF ). To benefit from the best methods, we need funding to expand capacity building and means of sharing our knowledge so that African countries can learn how to adapt to climate change. There are many opportunities and solutions for how to feed the world while better coping with the climate change that we collectively work on to tackle at events like COP. But without investment, these plans will just languish on paper.

"Group of 20 nations meets in Osaka and a lack of urgency to address our changing climate will be a hot topic. Leaders from the Group of 20 nations (G20) will meet in Osaka starting on Friday and wrangling is expected over the wording of a summit communique on combatting climate change. The United States – led by climate sceptic President Donald Trump – is pushing to downgrade the language against European opposition, according to sources and drafts of the text. The arguments are a reprise of tussles over global warming that have stymied talks in multilateral forums since Trump pulled the US out of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement to limit the effects of climate change. The latest draft, seen by Reuters news agency, includes language supporting the implementation of the Paris Agreement, and called the accord signed by 200 nations “irreversible”. An earlier draft didn’t include such language at the insistence of the United States, two sources familiar with the discussions over the communique said. Further changes are likely before the final adoption of the text on Saturday by G20 leaders.

France was one of the main drivers behind the Paris accord and the French parliament is now debating an energy bill that targets net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. “Negotiations on the topic of climate will be especially difficult this time,” a German government official said. Nations in Paris agreed to limit the global average rise from pre-industrial temperatures to well below 2 degrees Celsius. Current policies put the world on track for at least a 3C rise by the end of the century, according to a United Nations report in 2016. Investors managing more than $34 trillion in assets – nearly half the world’s invested capital – piled pressure on G20 leaders, demanding urgent action from governments on climate change. On Wednesday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged G20 countries to back more ambitious climate goals. Summit host Japan has been criticised for backing the continued use of coal for power generation, one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming. “Japan is proceeding with the coal-fired power plant at home and other countries as well, so we want Prime Minister Abe to end funding coal at home and overseas,” said  Hanna Song from the Japan Center for a Sustainable Environment and Society.  Japan ramped up the use of coal-fired generators inside the country after most nuclear power plants were shut down after the 2011 nuclear disaster in Fukushima.

"Group of 20 nations meets in Osaka and a lack of urgency to address our changing climate will be a hot topic.

"UN chief says world risks ‘sleepwalking past point of no return’ unless immediate action is taken on climate change. Madrid, Spain –   United Nations leaders and delegates kicked off COP25 on Monday in Madrid, launching a two-week summit on climate change with warnings over  the fast-rising perils of a global environmental challenge. “By the end of the coming decade we will be on one of two paths, one of which is sleepwalking past the point of no return,” said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in his opening address. “Do we want to be remembered as the generation that buried its head in the sand and fiddled as the planet burned?” The other pathway, Guterres said, was to aim for carbon neutrality by 2050. “There are calls from young people to do more, much more. They know we need to get on the right path today, not tomorrow, and COP25 offers us an opportunity.” The required global reduction of carbon emissions has more than doubled from 3.3 percent 10 years ago to seven percent now, he said, while the world was “still waiting for transformative movement from most G20 nations” responsible for three-quarters of carbon emissions. Hoesung Lee, the chair for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said “immediate reductions [of carbon emission] have powerful benefits for all sectors of society. “The failure to do so will result in the opposite of this, the world will suffer from shredded assets, the financial sector will have greater uncertainty and the environment will suffer from an increased loss of diversity.” He summed up grimly that “if we stay on our current path, [we] threaten our existence on this planet.” The conference was planned to take place in Chile , but unrest there saw the location changed after Spain stepped in at short notice. The South American nation continues to preside over the conference. Proceedings got under way in Madrid’s IFEMA exhibition and trade fair centre, with a handover ceremony bringing together officials from last year’s COP conference host country, Poland , and Carolina Schmidt Zaldivar, environment minister of this year’s presiding nation, Chile. Speaking later as COP25 President, Ms Schmidt thanked Spain for offering to hold the conference, after original host Chile, beset by ongoing social disorder, requested in late October for it to be moved elsewhere. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez insisted that COP25 “is Chile’s conference” before arguing that “given it was Europe that started the Industrial Revolution, Europe has to lead decarbonisation of the planet”. Sanchez proposed the creation of a major “Green Pact which unites innovation, digitalisation and fair employment”, and pointed out that “no country however powerful can be protected from the consequences of climate change”. Overall some 50 world leaders will attend, although one notable absentee will be US President Donald Trump , who last year announced his country’s withdrawal from the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change.  However, Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi will be present, leading a congressional delegation. Meanwhile, the Spanish prime minister is expected to hold meetings with other European Union leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron . Posters of Chilean landscapes flank the sides of the broad, treelined approach road to IFEMA on Madrid’s eastern side, where 25,000 delegates from nearly 200 countries will try to thrash out deals. Key meetings will centre on how the landmark 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement becomes fully operational, in particular mechanisms for trading carbon, as well as the groundwork needed for fresh climate pledges due to be made by all Paris signees before the end of 2020. “Article 6 [of the Paris agreement] was the outstanding issue not resolved at Katowice” – the Polish city where COP24 was held last November – “and to put a price on carbon is vital,” said Guterres. “Failure risks fragmenting carbon markets…there is no time to spare.” Security is tight at the IFEMA centre, with more than 5,000 Spanish police on duty outside the buildings, as well as 450 private agents backing up the UN’s own blue-clad operatives. Twenty cyclists from the Moving for Climate NOW organisation travelled 500 kilometres (311 miles) to arrive on electric bikes to hand a climate change manifesto to the conference authorities. Teenage Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg, travelling to the conference across the Atlantic Ocean by catamaran, is now expected to land in Lisbon on Tuesday and reach Madrid by train or electric car soon after. Local media reported she may take part in a large climate change demonstration in the Spanish capital on December 6.

Madrid, Spain –   United Nations leaders and delegates kicked off COP25 on Monday in Madrid, launching a two-week summit on climate change with warnings over  the fast-rising perils of a global environmental challenge. “By the end of the coming decade we will be on one of two paths, one of which is sleepwalking past the point of no return,” said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in his opening address. “Do we want to be remembered as the generation that buried its head in the sand and fiddled as the planet burned?” The other pathway, Guterres said, was to aim for carbon neutrality by 2050. “There are calls from young people to do more, much more. They know we need to get on the right path today, not tomorrow, and COP25 offers us an opportunity.” The required global reduction of carbon emissions has more than doubled from 3.3 percent 10 years ago to seven percent now, he said, while the world was “still waiting for transformative movement from most G20 nations” responsible for three-quarters of carbon emissions. Hoesung Lee, the chair for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said “immediate reductions [of carbon emission] have powerful benefits for all sectors of society. “The failure to do so will result in the opposite of this, the world will suffer from shredded assets, the financial sector will have greater uncertainty and the environment will suffer from an increased loss of diversity.” He summed up grimly that “if we stay on our current path, [we] threaten our existence on this planet.” The conference was planned to take place in Chile , but unrest there saw the location changed after Spain stepped in at short notice. The South American nation continues to preside over the conference. Proceedings got under way in Madrid’s IFEMA exhibition and trade fair centre, with a handover ceremony bringing together officials from last year’s COP conference host country, Poland , and Carolina Schmidt Zaldivar, environment minister of this year’s presiding nation, Chile. Speaking later as COP25 President, Ms Schmidt thanked Spain for offering to hold the conference, after original host Chile, beset by ongoing social disorder, requested in late October for it to be moved elsewhere. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez insisted that COP25 “is Chile’s conference” before arguing that “given it was Europe that started the Industrial Revolution, Europe has to lead decarbonisation of the planet”. Sanchez proposed the creation of a major “Green Pact which unites innovation, digitalisation and fair employment”, and pointed out that “no country however powerful can be protected from the consequences of climate change”. Overall some 50 world leaders will attend, although one notable absentee will be US President Donald Trump , who last year announced his country’s withdrawal from the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change.  However, Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi will be present, leading a congressional delegation. Meanwhile, the Spanish prime minister is expected to hold meetings with other European Union leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron . Posters of Chilean landscapes flank the sides of the broad, treelined approach road to IFEMA on Madrid’s eastern side, where 25,000 delegates from nearly 200 countries will try to thrash out deals. Key meetings will centre on how the landmark 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement becomes fully operational, in particular mechanisms for trading carbon, as well as the groundwork needed for fresh climate pledges due to be made by all Paris signees before the end of 2020. “Article 6 [of the Paris agreement] was the outstanding issue not resolved at Katowice” – the Polish city where COP24 was held last November – “and to put a price on carbon is vital,” said Guterres. “Failure risks fragmenting carbon markets…there is no time to spare.” Security is tight at the IFEMA centre, with more than 5,000 Spanish police on duty outside the buildings, as well as 450 private agents backing up the UN’s own blue-clad operatives. Twenty cyclists from the Moving for Climate NOW organisation travelled 500 kilometres (311 miles) to arrive on electric bikes to hand a climate change manifesto to the conference authorities. Teenage Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg, travelling to the conference across the Atlantic Ocean by catamaran, is now expected to land in Lisbon on Tuesday and reach Madrid by train or electric car soon after. Local media reported she may take part in a large climate change demonstration in the Spanish capital on December 6.

"Extinction Rebellion protesters bring parts of central London to a standstill to draw attention to global warming. Thousands of environmental protesters blocked access to landmarks and roads in central London, in an attempt to force the British government to declare climate change an emergency. Activists converged on Marble Arch, Oxford Circus, Piccadilly Circus and Parliament Square on Monday, while some smashed windows and daubed graffiti at the offices of energy giant Shell, near Waterloo. At sites across the British capital, campaigners chanted slogans and held placards that read “There is no Planet B” and “Extinction is forever”. Activists say the roadblocks could last for two weeks. By Tuesday morning, 113 adults had been arrested, most for breaching public order laws and  obstructing a highway ,  London’s Metropolitan Police said. The figure includes three men and two women who were arrested at the UK offices of energy giant Royal Dutch Shell on suspicion of criminal damage.  The protests are being led by the Extinction Rebellion group and will involve demonstrations in 80 cities in 33 countries around the world in the coming days. The group, which made headlines earlier this month when some of its members held a semi-nude protest in the British parliament during a Brexit debate, has warned its members they could face arrest for participation in non-violent civil disobedience. “The aim is to contribute to an escalating series of acts of civil disobedience which bring about change,” said Larch Maxey, 46, a spokesman for the movement. “The plan is disruption and that disruption escalates until you get the attention of the people you are persuading to change,” he said. Extinction Rebellion, which was launched in October by academics, wants the government to declare a climate and ecological emergency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025, halt biodiversity loss and create “citizen assemblies on climate and ecological justice” to oversee climate policy. Reporting from Marble Arch in central London, Al Jazeera’s Bernard Smith said the protesters planned to camp there for at least three days. “They are using this new type of civil disobedience to get the message of climate change across,” he said. “They have even set up solar panels because their intention is to camp out here. “They say they are doing it because of the frustration over decades of warnings over climate change being ignored – and the only way they can get people to take notice is to do this sort of civil disobedience.” On Waterloo Bridge, demonstrators set up a skateboard ramp and vegetarian food stalls, while others marched up and down the bridge behind a group of drummers. Ruby Brookman, 22, a volunteer who helps refugees, told AFP news agency: “I’m here because our generation is going to be affected by this. “I work with refugees and we saw people moving with climate change: drought in East Africa a while ago, the recent hurricanes in Zimbabwe.” Protester Olivia Evershed, 23, said climate policies must be altered quickly to prevent catastrophic changes. “If we don’t do anything to change this, our children will die,” she told the Associated Press news agency. Hollywood actor Willem Dafoe said he was sending a video message in support of the activists, telling them: “I’m with you.” The group is also supported by US academic Noam Chomsky , as well as Canadian author Naomi Klein .

"Extinction Rebellion protesters bring parts of central London to a standstill to draw attention to global warming. Thousands of environmental protesters blocked access to landmarks and roads in central London, in an attempt to force the British government to declare climate change an emergency. Activists converged on Marble Arch, Oxford Circus, Piccadilly Circus and Parliament Square on Monday, while some smashed windows and daubed graffiti at the offices of energy giant Shell, near Waterloo. At sites across the British capital, campaigners chanted slogans and held placards that read “There is no Planet B” and “Extinction is forever”. Activists say the roadblocks could last for two weeks. By Tuesday morning, 113 adults had been arrested, most for breaching public order laws and  obstructing a highway ,  London’s Metropolitan Police said. The figure includes three men and two women who were arrested at the UK offices of energy giant Royal Dutch Shell on suspicion of criminal damage.  The protests are being led by the Extinction Rebellion group and will involve demonstrations in 80 cities in 33 countries around the world in the coming days. The group, which made headlines earlier this month when some of its members held a semi-nude protest in the British parliament during a Brexit debate, has warned its members they could face arrest for participation in non-violent civil disobedience. “The aim is to contribute to an escalating series of acts of civil disobedience which bring about change,” said Larch Maxey, 46, a spokesman for the movement. “The plan is disruption and that disruption escalates until you get the attention of the people you are persuading to change,” he said. Extinction Rebellion, which was launched in October by academics, wants the government to declare a climate and ecological emergency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025, halt biodiversity loss and create “citizen assemblies on climate and ecological justice” to oversee climate policy. Reporting from Marble Arch in central London, Al Jazeera’s Bernard Smith said the protesters planned to camp there for at least three days. “They are using this new type of civil disobedience to get the message of climate change across,” he said. “They have even set up solar panels because their intention is to camp out here. “They say they are doing it because of the frustration over decades of warnings over climate change being ignored – and the only way they can get people to take notice is to do this sort of civil disobedience.” On Waterloo Bridge, demonstrators set up a skateboard ramp and vegetarian food stalls, while others marched up and down the bridge behind a group of drummers. Ruby Brookman, 22, a volunteer who helps refugees, told AFP news agency: “I’m here because our generation is going to be affected by this. “I work with refugees and we saw people moving with climate change: drought in East Africa a while ago, the recent hurricanes in Zimbabwe.” Protester Olivia Evershed, 23, said climate policies must be altered quickly to prevent catastrophic changes. “If we don’t do anything to change this, our children will die,” she told the Associated Press news agency.

"As the US rejoins the Paris Agreement, richer nations are failing to meet financial commitments to help poorer countries adapt to climate change. Wholesale derision greeted a spectacularly clueless statement from Republican Senator Ted Cruz last week, after President Joe Biden committed to signing the United States back up to the Paris Agreement . Cruz said Biden is “more interested in the views of the citizens of Paris than in the jobs of the citizens of Pittsburgh”. Cruz’s comment was met with abject criticism on Twitter where users pointed out the obvious: the Paris Agreement is a multinational effort and not, obviously, focused solely on the people of Paris. The trouble is Cruz is not alone. Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boebart was just one who echoed his words, saying she does not work for the people of Paris. Which, if you think of the raft of climate policy Biden needs to get through Congress, makes you realise the challenge still at hand convincing those lawmakers who either doubt reality, or act as such for the sake of the constituents who voted them in. One could say that even those who advocate positive change have been equally obstructive in enacting it. If we look at the billions promised by richer nations at the 2015 negotiations in Paris, earmarked to help poorer nations adapt to climate change, the contributions have been woefully short. A total $100bn per year was promised, yet the amount of financing stands at an estimated $20-30bn, according to World Wildlife Fund’s (WWF) deputy climate lead Vanessa Perez-Cirera – no more than 30 percent of what was committed. And according to the UN Environment Programme’s Adaptation Gap Report , $500bn a year is the amount we should be targeting anyway. Still, with the headwind of a new US presidency, optimism by pledge was once again ramped up at the virtual Climate Adaptation Summit hosted in the Netherlands this week. Veteran negotiator John Kerry, appointed as Biden’s climate envoy, is back in the fray , pointing out that a drastic reduction in emissions must go hand in hand with adaptation to manage the effects of extreme weather. “There is no adapting to a 3C or 4C world, except for the very richest and most privileged,” he warned. “Some of the impacts are inevitable, but if we don’t act boldly and immediately by building resilience, we will see dramatic reversals in economic development for everybody, and the poorest and most vulnerable communities will pay the highest price.” When I spoke to WWF’s Perez-Cirera, she said adaptation is a moral imperative of climate justice and inaction will have disastrous consequences. “If we do not adapt there will be a huge impact in terms of social unrest,” she told me. “We are talking about massive migrations from south to north, with water and food disputes between nations. And conflicts. Conflicts between countries and within countries.” She said that with desperate economies struggling to clamber out of recession, everyone is competing for public finance. “But there is hope,” Perez-Cirera added. “We can bring synergistic approach to investments which will help the world to adapt to climate change while mitigating its effects at the same time.” That means funding nature-based solutions to build back better, and investing in the likes of forests, coral reefs and mangroves to help populations adapt to the worst effects of climate change while reducing emissions at the same time. It seems like sound policy, but convincing the likes of Ted Cruz and the Trumpian dinosaurs may be a forlorn hope.

Set to cover multiple states and cities in the US, people can look forward to swarms of insects and the deafening noise of their mating calls. 2. Brazil’s budget cuts: In another blow to environmental efforts, Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro’s government has proposed the smallest environmental protection budget in at least 13 years for 2021. 3. Clean cars: With prices falling and Joe Biden pushing for a transition to electric vehicles, many advocates hope that the rise of clean cars is finally under way. 4.

"As the US rejoins the Paris Agreement, richer nations are failing to meet financial commitments to help poorer countries adapt to climate change. Wholesale derision greeted a spectacularly clueless statement from Republican Senator Ted Cruz last week, after President Joe Biden committed to signing the United States back up to the Paris Agreement . Cruz said Biden is “more interested in the views of the citizens of Paris than in the jobs of the citizens of Pittsburgh”. Cruz’s comment was met with abject criticism on Twitter where users pointed out the obvious: the Paris Agreement is a multinational effort and not, obviously, focused solely on the people of Paris. The trouble is Cruz is not alone. Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boebart was just one who echoed his words, saying she does not work for the people of Paris. Which, if you think of the raft of climate policy Biden needs to get through Congress, makes you realise the challenge still at hand convincing those lawmakers who either doubt reality, or act as such for the sake of the constituents who voted them in. One could say that even those who advocate positive change have been equally obstructive in enacting it. If we look at the billions promised by richer nations at the 2015 negotiations in Paris, earmarked to help poorer nations adapt to climate change, the contributions have been woefully short. A total $100bn per year was promised, yet the amount of financing stands at an estimated $20-30bn, according to World Wildlife Fund’s (WWF) deputy climate lead Vanessa Perez-Cirera – no more than 30 percent of what was committed. And according to the UN Environment Programme’s Adaptation Gap Report , $500bn a year is the amount we should be targeting anyway. Still, with the headwind of a new US presidency, optimism by pledge was once again ramped up at the virtual Climate Adaptation Summit hosted in the Netherlands this week. Veteran negotiator John Kerry, appointed as Biden’s climate envoy, is back in the fray , pointing out that a drastic reduction in emissions must go hand in hand with adaptation to manage the effects of extreme weather. “There is no adapting to a 3C or 4C world, except for the very richest and most privileged,” he warned. “Some of the impacts are inevitable, but if we don’t act boldly and immediately by building resilience, we will see dramatic reversals in economic development for everybody, and the poorest and most vulnerable communities will pay the highest price.” When I spoke to WWF’s Perez-Cirera, she said adaptation is a moral imperative of climate justice and inaction will have disastrous consequences. “If we do not adapt there will be a huge impact in terms of social unrest,” she told me. “We are talking about massive migrations from south to north, with water and food disputes between nations. And conflicts. Conflicts between countries and within countries.” She said that with desperate economies struggling to clamber out of recession, everyone is competing for public finance. “But there is hope,” Perez-Cirera added. “We can bring synergistic approach to investments which will help the world to adapt to climate change while mitigating its effects at the same time.” That means funding nature-based solutions to build back better, and investing in the likes of forests, coral reefs and mangroves to help populations adapt to the worst effects of climate change while reducing emissions at the same time. It seems like sound policy, but convincing the likes of Ted Cruz and the Trumpian dinosaurs may be a forlorn hope.

"Climate change is displacing a growing number of people; governments are responding by privatising border policing. In the last few months, all publicly known banking partners of the US private prison and immigrant detention leader GEO Group have committed to  severing their ties  with the industry. The banks’ decision was a major win for campaigners and grassroots activists who have long been working to stop the flow of capital into companies profiting from the destructive combination of mass incarceration in the United States, more aggressive border control policies and increased migration flows exacerbated by climate change. The survival of private prisons depends on keeping a consistent and increasing number of people incarcerated and today immigrants serve as this predatory industry’s primary cash generators. According to a report by the  New York Times , last year, private companies incarcerated about nine percent of the total US prison population, but 73 percent of immigrant detainees. Meanwhile, a  growing body of evidence  points to  climate change being the “silent driver” behind the immigration from Central America and southern Mexico to the US. While violence, organised crime, systemic corruption and poverty, which in many ways are the result of a long history of US meddling and militarism in the region, are the most cited reasons for the exodus from South to North America, experts say climate change in the region is exacerbating – and sometimes causing – these problems, and forcing people to move. The connection between displacement and climate change is not exclusive to the Americas. Similarly, some researchers link Syria’s devastating conflict, which displaced millions of people, to a drought made worse by climate change. The climate emergency in Africa’s Lake Chad region is also believed to have contributed to the rise of Boko Haram – an armed group that has displaced over two million people. In other words, many of the displaced today – in the Americas, the Middle East and Africa alike – are being driven from their homes, at least in part, because of the destructive effects of climate change. And this seems to be just the beginning. A new report by the Red Cross estimates that within  10 years, 150 million people will require humanitarian assistance  due to the climate crisis. This builds upon alarming predictions from the  World Bank  and the UN’s  International Organization for Migration  that there could be 143-200 million climate migrants by 2050.   All this makes the fight against corporations, like GEO Group, that stand to profit from the expansion of the climate crisis even more urgent. And it is important to take action not only against p rivate prisons and detention centres, and the corporations that run them, but also more generally against the growing global border-industrial complex which is feeding on the suffering and devastation caused by climate change. Western governments from Washington to Canberra view the climate crisis through the lens of national security. Even though they are the primary cause behind global warming, they are constantly looking for ways to separate themselves from its consequences. This is why the world’s biggest polluters – including the US, which has emitted more metric tonnes of greenhouse gas pollution than any other country since the Industrial Revolution – are constructing unprecedented border regimes. These governments are seeing climate migrants not as people but “security threats” and heavily investing in private companies that are promising to eliminate this threat using walls, bullets, drones and cages. Thanks to the Western fear of migrants and unwillingness to come up with a sustainable and humane solution to the climate crisis, this border-industrial complex has grown strong enough to help shape national immigration policies and fuel militarisation and human rights abuses across the world. The US’ dependence on this industry has reached the point where its budget for border and immigration control has gone up  more than 15-fold in the last 25 years  and increased by an astonishing 133,567 percent since 1980. We are seeing similar trends elsewhere in the world. In 2009, the European market for border control security was estimated to be between 6 and 8 billion euros ($7-9bn).

"Climate change is displacing a growing number of people; governments are responding by privatising border policing. In the last few months, all publicly known banking partners of the US private prison and immigrant detention leader GEO Group have committed to  severing their ties  with the industry. The banks’ decision was a major win for campaigners and grassroots activists who have long been working to stop the flow of capital into companies profiting from the destructive combination of mass incarceration in the United States, more aggressive border control policies and increased migration flows exacerbated by climate change. The survival of private prisons depends on keeping a consistent and increasing number of people incarcerated and today immigrants serve as this predatory industry’s primary cash generators. According to a report by the  New York Times , last year, private companies incarcerated about nine percent of the total US prison population, but 73 percent of immigrant detainees. Meanwhile, a  growing body of evidence  points to  climate change being the “silent driver” behind the immigration from Central America and southern Mexico to the US. While violence, organised crime, systemic corruption and poverty, which in many ways are the result of a long history of US meddling and militarism in the region, are the most cited reasons for the exodus from South to North America, experts say climate change in the region is exacerbating – and sometimes causing – these problems, and forcing people to move. The connection between displacement and climate change is not exclusive to the Americas. Similarly, some researchers link Syria’s devastating conflict, which displaced millions of people, to a drought made worse by climate change. The climate emergency in Africa’s Lake Chad region is also believed to have contributed to the rise of Boko Haram – an armed group that has displaced over two million people. In other words, many of the displaced today – in the Americas, the Middle East and Africa alike – are being driven from their homes, at least in part, because of the destructive effects of climate change. And this seems to be just the beginning. A new report by the Red Cross estimates that within  10 years, 150 million people will require humanitarian assistance  due to the climate crisis. This builds upon alarming predictions from the  World Bank  and the UN’s  International Organization for Migration  that there could be 143-200 million climate migrants by 2050.   All this makes the fight against corporations, like GEO Group, that stand to profit from the expansion of the climate crisis even more urgent. And it is important to take action not only against p rivate prisons and detention centres, and the corporations that run them, but also more generally against the growing global border-industrial complex which is feeding on the suffering and devastation caused by climate change. Western governments from Washington to Canberra view the climate crisis through the lens of national security. Even though they are the primary cause behind global warming, they are constantly looking for ways to separate themselves from its consequences. This is why the world’s biggest polluters – including the US, which has emitted more metric tonnes of greenhouse gas pollution than any other country since the Industrial Revolution – are constructing unprecedented border regimes. These governments are seeing climate migrants not as people but “security threats” and heavily investing in private companies that are promising to eliminate this threat using walls, bullets, drones and cages. Thanks to the Western fear of migrants and unwillingness to come up with a sustainable and humane solution to the climate crisis, this border-industrial complex has grown strong enough to help shape national immigration policies and fuel militarisation and human rights abuses across the world. The US’ dependence on this industry has reached the point where its budget for border and immigration control has gone up  more than 15-fold in the last 25 years  and increased by an astonishing 133,567 percent since 1980. We are seeing similar trends elsewhere in the world. In 2009, the European market for border control security was estimated to be between 6 and 8 billion euros ($7-9bn).

The survival of private prisons depends on keeping a consistent and increasing number of people incarcerated and today immigrants serve as this predatory industry’s primary cash generators. According to a report by the  New York Times , last year, private companies incarcerated about nine percent of the total US prison population, but 73 percent of immigrant detainees. Meanwhile, a  growing body of evidence  points to  climate change being the “silent driver” behind the immigration from Central America and southern Mexico to the US. While violence, organised crime, systemic corruption and poverty, which in many ways are the result of a long history of US meddling and militarism in the region, are the most cited reasons for the exodus from South to North America, experts say climate change in the region is exacerbating – and sometimes causing – these problems, and forcing people to move. The connection between displacement and climate change is not exclusive to the Americas. Similarly, some researchers link Syria’s devastating conflict, which displaced millions of people, to a drought made worse by climate change. The climate emergency in Africa’s Lake Chad region is also believed to have contributed to the rise of Boko Haram – an armed group that has displaced over two million people. In other words, many of the displaced today – in the Americas, the Middle East and Africa alike – are being driven from their homes, at least in part, because of the destructive effects of climate change. And this seems to be just the beginning. A new report by the Red Cross estimates that within  10 years, 150 million people will require humanitarian assistance  due to the climate crisis. This builds upon alarming predictions from the  World Bank  and the UN’s  International Organization for Migration  that there could be 143-200 million climate migrants by 2050.   All this makes the fight against corporations, like GEO Group, that stand to profit from the expansion of the climate crisis even more urgent. And it is important to take action not only against p rivate prisons and detention centres, and the corporations that run them, but also more generally against the growing global border-industrial complex which is feeding on the suffering and devastation caused by climate change. Western governments from Washington to Canberra view the climate crisis through the lens of national security. Even though they are the primary cause behind global warming, they are constantly looking for ways to separate themselves from its consequences. This is why the world’s biggest polluters – including the US, which has emitted more metric tonnes of greenhouse gas pollution than any other country since the Industrial Revolution – are constructing unprecedented border regimes. These governments are seeing climate migrants not as people but “security threats” and heavily investing in private companies that are promising to eliminate this threat using walls, bullets, drones and cages. Thanks to the Western fear of migrants and unwillingness to come up with a sustainable and humane solution to the climate crisis, this border-industrial complex has grown strong enough to help shape national immigration policies and fuel militarisation and human rights abuses across the world. The US’ dependence on this industry has reached the point where its budget for border and immigration control has gone up  more than 15-fold in the last 25 years  and increased by an astonishing 133,567 percent since 1980. We are seeing similar trends elsewhere in the world. In 2009, the European market for border control security was estimated to be between 6 and 8 billion euros ($7-9bn). Today, this market is estimated to reach 50 billion euros globally ($57bn) by 2022. The expanding reach of this mercenary industry into security, surveillance and detention operations across the Western world has implications for the freedom and rights of everyone, not only the millions who are forced to seek sanctuary in these countries for reasons beyond their control. For those in the West, it means that private corporations focused on financial gain will be increasingly responsible for policing.  For migrants and refugees, it means facing more exclusionary border policies and violence. There will be more walls and detention centres and more impunity for repressive tactics, delivered through a suite of corporate service providers gearing up to profit from abusive responses to the climate crisis.   This expanding “border industrial complex” is the nexus between border policing, militarisation and financial interest. It is the product of Western governments that are unwilling to respond humanely to a crisis of their own making. This is why, in the aftermath of the largest international mobilisation around climate inaction, the movement must turn its attention to the human rights abuses linked to climate-induced displacement and migration. We cannot resign ourselves to a climate future defined by walls, bullets, drones, cops and cages.

"Two-thirds of respondents say economic benefits from net-zero emissions by 2050 would outweigh the cost of achieving it. A growing number of climate economists say the world should take “immediate and drastic action” to tackle climate change, according to a survey published Tuesday. Failing to do so could cost the world some $1.7 trillion a year by the middle of this decade, escalating to about $30 trillion a year by 2075, according to estimates by the 738 economists from around the world surveyed by New York University’s Institute for Policy Integrity. “People joke about how economists can’t agree on most things,” said Derek Sylvan, the institute’s strategy director and one of the authors of the survey. “But we seem to find a pretty strong level of consensus” on the economic importance of climate action. Three-quarters of respondents strongly agreed that drastic action should be taken immediately, compared with just half of the economists polled by the same institute in 2015. For another question on reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, two-thirds said the costs of investing towards that global goal would be outweighed by the economic benefits, which would include preventing natural disasters, preserving coastal infrastructure and assets and protecting food supplies. To avoid catastrophic climate change, scientists say the world needs to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 – meaning people are adding no more emissions to the atmosphere than they are removing. Sylvan said he was surprised that so many saw net-zero action as “economically desirable, even on the pretty short timeline that we’re talking about”. Most of the international climate economists questioned for the survey in February said they had become more concerned about climate change over the last five years. The most common reason they gave was the escalation in recent extreme weather events, which have included climate-linked wildfires and heatwaves. The world saw more than 7,300 major natural disasters between 2000 and 2019, which killed some 1.2 million people and cost $3 trillion in damages, according to the UN Office on Disaster Risk Reduction. That compares with about 4,200 disasters, leading to 1.19 million killed and $1.6 trillion in losses during the 20 years previous, the data show. “Some places are more exposed, and current levels of income matter a great deal,” said Michael Greenstone, an economist at the University of Chicago and the director of the Energy Policy Institute at Chicago. The fallout from climate change will impact people and nations Economic disparities make it hard to apply simple cost-benefit analyses, he said. For example, a poor family will feel economic losses more acutely than a wealthy family. “How do we think about a dollar of climate damage to (billionaires) Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos versus a family of four living below the poverty line?

"Two-thirds of respondents say economic benefits from net-zero emissions by 2050 would outweigh the cost of achieving it. A growing number of climate economists say the world should take “immediate and drastic action” to tackle climate change, according to a survey published Tuesday. Failing to do so could cost the world some $1.7 trillion a year by the middle of this decade, escalating to about $30 trillion a year by 2075, according to estimates by the 738 economists from around the world surveyed by New York University’s Institute for Policy Integrity. “People joke about how economists can’t agree on most things,” said Derek Sylvan, the institute’s strategy director and one of the authors of the survey. “But we seem to find a pretty strong level of consensus” on the economic importance of climate action. Three-quarters of respondents strongly agreed that drastic action should be taken immediately, compared with just half of the economists polled by the same institute in 2015. For another question on reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, two-thirds said the costs of investing towards that global goal would be outweighed by the economic benefits, which would include preventing natural disasters, preserving coastal infrastructure and assets and protecting food supplies. To avoid catastrophic climate change, scientists say the world needs to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 – meaning people are adding no more emissions to the atmosphere than they are removing. Sylvan said he was surprised that so many saw net-zero action as “economically desirable, even on the pretty short timeline that we’re talking about”. Most of the international climate economists questioned for the survey in February said they had become more concerned about climate change over the last five years. The most common reason they gave was the escalation in recent extreme weather events, which have included climate-linked wildfires and heatwaves. The world saw more than 7,300 major natural disasters between 2000 and 2019, which killed some 1.2 million people and cost $3 trillion in damages, according to the UN Office on Disaster Risk Reduction. That compares with about 4,200 disasters, leading to 1.19 million killed and $1.6 trillion in losses during the 20 years previous, the data show. “Some places are more exposed, and current levels of income matter a great deal,” said Michael Greenstone, an economist at the University of Chicago and the director of the Energy Policy Institute at Chicago. The fallout from climate change will impact people and nations Economic disparities make it hard to apply simple cost-benefit analyses, he said. For example, a poor family will feel economic losses more acutely than a wealthy family. “How do we think about a dollar of climate damage to (billionaires) Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos versus a family of four living below the poverty line?

"With the world population expected to rise, “we need to produce more food with less emissions”. There are so many individual aspects of daily life in industrialised countries that are associated with the changing climate. We talk about energy efficiency with our automobiles, our air conditioners and other appliances, even the light bulbs over our kitchen tables.  But for the most part, the food served on the kitchen table has not yet joined the climate conversation, and it should. It is estimated that the food systems produce between a fifth and third of the greenhouse gases emitted by people on this planet.    This calculation includes every part of food production and distribution – including growing crops and raising livestock, manufacturing fertiliser and storing, transporting and refrigerating food. Agriculture accounts for around 80 per cent of these emissions, but the combined contribution of transport, refrigeration, consumer practices and waste management is growing as countries develop.  Climate-friendly food While this news is not a complete surprise to most of us, we still do not shop for groceries according to emissions footprints. For example, if we want to reduce our greenhouse gas footprint, we should eat chicken instead of pork, and pork instead of beef.  While eating local foods has many advantages, in some circumstances we are better not to go local. For example, tomatoes grown in heated UK greenhouses result in six times greater greenhouse gases than those grown in the sun in Spain, even taking into account the emissions from transportation.  But will Londoners shop for meat and tomatoes according to greenhouse gases? It’s not included on the food label, so it’s not a decision point that’s readily available. Consumers would need to actively chase after this data, and the time to do this research is as much a luxury as the food choice available in northern supermarkets.  As you can see, the question of climate-friendly food is not the easiest one to tackle and one cannot blindly rely on market forces to carry the day. Making matters more difficult, the need to reduce the impact of food production on climate change is only one part of the crisis that we face. With the world population expected to rise by another one billion people in 15 years’ time, we need to produce more food with less emissions while adapting to changing climates.  The burden of this crisis does not fall, for the most part, in the kitchens of London. Rather, spin the globe to South Asia, with 300 million people currently undernourished, to Sub-Saharan Africa, with 234 million people in similar straits and to East and Southeast Asia, with 233 million people undernourished.  Under climate change, yields of maize, rice and wheat – the three largest sources of calories around the world – will decrease in many developing countries as temperatures rise and rainfall becomes more unpredictable.  Three-pronged crisis By 2050, climate change could cause irrigated wheat yields in developing countries to fall by 13 per cent. Irrigated rice in these same countries could tumble by 15 per cent. In Africa, many farmers of maize, which is not that well suited to increased temperatures, could lose 10 to 20 per cent of their yields.  Many answers to this three-pronged crisis do not address all three; often times a past solution exacerbates another part of the problem. For example, synthetic fertiliser has been used with great success to increase crop yields. But fertiliser is also fingered as a key contributor to agriculture’s climate impacts.  Representatives of governments from all over the world are meeting at the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Doha, Qatar . In years past, talks at this annual meeting have focused primarily on reducing emissions, an important problem that should have been tackled a decade ago. But the pace of climate change has far outstripped the pace of negotiations.  Delegates, while keeping a focus on reducing humanity’s greenhouse gas emissions, now desperately need to focus on adapting to the changing climate – how to grow more food is at the centre of this critical need. New methods and tools need to be implemented, technology to share innovations needs to be adopted and more research needs to accelerate the pace. Money must be spent to make this happen, to ensure our survival.  Most of all, political will must be found to confront the most important issue on our planet today.

"Data from Brazil’s space agency suggests fires in the Amazon are on track for a seven percent increase over last year. Fires in the Brazilian Amazon have surged far in August, government data on Friday showed, outstripping the same period of 2019 and renewing concerns about the destruction of the world’s largest rainforest, which is a critical bulwark against climate change. Brazilian space research agency INPE recorded 5,860 fires in the Amazon in the first six days of August, a seven percent increase from the same period of last year. The data set is small and daily variation can be considerable, but the trend suggests this month may be on par with a year ago – the worst August in nine years. Witnesses driving on Thursday night along the BR-319 highway from Porto Velho, Rondonia, towards Humaita, in the state of Amazonas, spotted small fires crackling along the side of the road, with smoke hanging heavy over the asphalt. Some of the areas burned last year were now being used for cattle raising. Fire is commonly used across the Amazon to clear land for pasture. The Brazilian Amazon lost 9,205sq km (3,554sq miles) of vegetation in the 12 months ending in July, according to data from the country’s space agency. That was largely due to a surge of fires in August and September last year. The overall loss was 34 percent greater than that of the prior 12-month period. The data was produced by Brazil’s DETER monitoring system, which provides daily deforestation alerts based on satellite images. Data from another system named PRODES, which relies on more detailed satellite images and records more of the deforestation, will be released by the end of the year. Both are administered by Brazil’s space institute, which tabulates annual deforestation starting with August, when the dry season starts and farmers and loggers traditionally start using fires to clear land. “If the variation between DETER and PRODES figures remains at the historical average, we could have about 13,000 square kilometers of deforestation, the highest rate since 2006 and three times more than the National Climate Change Policy target for 2020,” said the Climate Observatory, comprised of more than 30 non-governmental groups. “This is not because of government incompetence in combating devastation; it has been happening because the Bolsonaro administration’s agenda is to actively promote devastation,” the statement added. “This is not incompetence; it’s a design.” Environmental advocates blame right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro’s vision of economic development in the Amazon for emboldening illegal loggers, miners and land speculators to destroy the forest. Bolsonaro says more mining and farming are needed in the region to lift people out of poverty. Bolsonaro came to office promising to open more of the Amazon to development, such as farming and mining. But international concern has led investors to try to distance themselves from the deforestation and to pressure the government to take more action against it. Following global pressure from foreign governments and investors, Bolsonaro has deployed the military to combat deforestation and in May he stationed troops in several states ahead of the so-called burning season. DETER data for July registered a decrease from the same month in 2019, when deforestation surged to the highest monthly level since at least mid-2015. Criminals often extract valuable wood from protected parts of the jungle before setting fire to the land, increasing its value for farming and ranching. Large natural fires are very rare in a healthy rainforest.

Witnesses driving on Thursday night along the BR-319 highway from Porto Velho, Rondonia, towards Humaita, in the state of Amazonas, spotted small fires crackling along the side of the road, with smoke hanging heavy over the asphalt. Some of the areas burned last year were now being used for cattle raising. Fire is commonly used across the Amazon to clear land for pasture. The Brazilian Amazon lost 9,205sq km (3,554sq miles) of vegetation in the 12 months ending in July, according to data from the country’s space agency. That was largely due to a surge of fires in August and September last year. The overall loss was 34 percent greater than that of the prior 12-month period. The data was produced by Brazil’s DETER monitoring system, which provides daily deforestation alerts based on satellite images. Data from another system named PRODES, which relies on more detailed satellite images and records more of the deforestation, will be released by the end of the year. Both are administered by Brazil’s space institute, which tabulates annual deforestation starting with August, when the dry season starts and farmers and loggers traditionally start using fires to clear land. “If the variation between DETER and PRODES figures remains at the historical average, we could have about 13,000 square kilometers of deforestation, the highest rate since 2006 and three times more than the National Climate Change Policy target for 2020,” said the Climate Observatory, comprised of more than 30 non-governmental groups. “This is not because of government incompetence in combating devastation; it has been happening because the Bolsonaro administration’s agenda is to actively promote devastation,” the statement added. “This is not incompetence; it’s a design.” Environmental advocates blame right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro’s vision of economic development in the Amazon for emboldening illegal loggers, miners and land speculators to destroy the forest. Bolsonaro says more mining and farming are needed in the region to lift people out of poverty. Bolsonaro came to office promising to open more of the Amazon to development, such as farming and mining. But international concern has led investors to try to distance themselves from the deforestation and to pressure the government to take more action against it. Following global pressure from foreign governments and investors, Bolsonaro has deployed the military to combat deforestation and in May he stationed troops in several states ahead of the so-called burning season. DETER data for July registered a decrease from the same month in 2019, when deforestation surged to the highest monthly level since at least mid-2015. Criminals often extract valuable wood from protected parts of the jungle before setting fire to the land, increasing its value for farming and ranching. Large natural fires are very rare in a healthy rainforest.

Climate change - Climate change refers to the long-term changes in weather patterns and temperatures that are caused by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

Illegal logging - Illegal logging is the practice of cutting down trees in protected areas or without proper permits, which can lead to habitat destruction, soil erosion, and biodiversity loss.

Miners - Miners are people who extract minerals and resources from the Earth, which can have negative environmental impacts such as water pollution, deforestation, and soil degradation.

Land speculators - Land speculators are people who purchase land with the intention of selling it for a profit in the future. This can lead to habitat destruction and ecosystem degradation if the land is not managed sustainably.","Amazonas, Região Norte, Brasil",-4.479925,-63.5185396

"The decision follows power outages in Texas due to an extreme cold snap that left millions of people without electricity. Federal energy regulators in the United States say they will examine threats that climate change and extreme weather events pose to the country’s electric reliability in the wake of last week’s deadly Texas freeze that left millions of people without power. “The effects of climate change are already apparent,” Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Chairman Richard Glick said in a statement on Monday. “We must do everything we can within our statutory authority to ensure that the electric grid is capable of keeping the lights (on) in the face of extreme weather.” FERC, which regulates the interstate transmission of electricity, oil and natural gas and approves fossil fuel projects such as pipelines, could play a big role in US President Joe Biden’s promise to make the power grid emissions-free by 2035. It was not immediately clear how FERC, a panel of five commissioners which has a 3-2 Republican majority until about June, can help to ensure that power delivery remains reliable in an age of extreme weather events. In California last August a crushing heatwave led to rolling blackouts for two days. Ten years ago, after a milder Texas cold snap led to power outages, FERC looked into ways to protect the grid and wrote recommendations for how to make natural gas and other installations more resilient to extreme cold. “We followed up on those for a couple of years, but actual implementation was in the hands primarily of the Texas authorities who run the grid, and as memories faded most of those steps were not taken,” former FERC chair Cheryl LaFleur told the Reuters news agency in a video interview. She said the severity of last week’s freeze, which killed at least 24 people, should prompt a stronger response. Earlier this month, Glick, a Democrat, said FERC will create the panel’s first position to oversee environmental justice. The person will ensure that FERC decisions do not unfairly hurt historically marginalised communities with pollution, he said. The commission also said its enforcement office is examining wholesale natural gas and electricity market activity to see whether an investigation is necessary following a surge in power prices during the Texas cold snap. Wholesale power prices in the state soared more than 300-fold, stirring memories of price spikes that accompanied California’s energy crisis of 2000-2001, when now-bankrupt energy trading giant Enron and others artificially boosted prices. On Saturday, US Senator Tina Smith wrote to regulators, including FERC, calling for an investigation of any price gouging by natural gas producers and suppliers.

"Desertification or land degradation already affects more than 500 million people in the world’s poorest countries. London, United Kingdom –  Better land management and the consumption of healthier diets can help address climate change, says the first comprehensive study on the interactions linking land and climate systems. Climate Change and Land , published on Thursday by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) –  the UN agency responsible for assessing climate change science – looks at the role land use can play in contributing to or mitigating global warming. However, the agency points out that sustainable land use is only one aspect of a strategy that should aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors in order to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. That deal, signed in 2015 by more than 200 countries, aimed to limit global warming to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels while pursuing efforts to limit the rise to 1.5C. “Land is undergoing human pressure, land is part of the solution, but land cannot do it all,” Debra Roberts, one of the authors of the report and cochair of the working group assessing climate effect and adaptation told journalists at a news conference in Geneva. While land use, including forestry and agriculture, accounts for at least 23 percent of human greenhouse gas emissions, land is also able to absorb nearly a third of emissions from fossil fuels and industry. 
				We have a lot of choice about the way we manage land in the future, the diet that we eat, and these choices can have large impacts			 
				 by  Joanna House, IPCC report author			 “We need to look at how we can reduce emissions from land and how we can use it to cause carbon removal,” Joanna House, one of the report’s lead authors and a reader in environmental science and policy at the University of Bristol, told Al Jazeera. “We have a lot of choice about the way we manage land in the future, the diet that we eat, and these choices can have large impacts,” she added. “It’s all about the choices people and governments make moving forward. What is clear is we need urgent action now across all sectors. Not just reducing emissions from land, but from energy, and to avoid the climate impact on land.” The report addresses land degradation, caused by unprecedented rates of land and freshwater use due to population growth as well as changes in the consumption of food, timber and energy. “We humans affect more than 70 percent of ice-free land. A quarter of this land is degraded,” said Valerie Masson-Delmotte, cochair of the IPCC’s working group addressing the physical science basis on climate change. “The way we produce food and what we eat contributes to the loss of nature and ecosystems and declining biodiversity. When land is degraded, it reduces the soil’s ability to take up carbon, and this exacerbates climate change. In turn, climate change exacerbates land degradation.” More than 500 million people currently live in areas that already experience desertification or degradation, mostly in the world’s poorest countries, which are also the most exposed to food insecurity. “The countries that are most food insecure are the ones that have done the least to cause the climate problem, and part of that is a question about geography,” Katherine Kramer, global climate lead at Christian Aid, which released a report on climate change and food security earlier this week, told Al Jazeera. 					 
				 		 “Certain parts of the world are warming much more rapidly and are much more prone to have extreme weather events,” she continued. “These tend to be in the poorest countries and of course the impact will be greater there because they have the least resilience to be able to cope.” The IPCC report stresses the importance of reducing food waste. Between 2010 and 2016, global food loss and waste contributed between eight and 10 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions produced by human activities. Between 25 and 30 percent of the food we produce is currently lost or wasted. “Underlying this report is the fact that a relatively small number of giant meat, agribusiness and biofuel companies are responsible for the bulk of deforestation and other climate pollution in the agriculture sector,” said Glenn Hurowitz, CEO of global campaign group Mighty Earth. A shift towards low-carbon diets – eating less meat and more plant-based foods such as grains, vegetables and nuts – is also among the recommendations. “Changing dietary practices [can help] free up land that we can then use for sustainable food production or carbon mitigation in other ways,” House said. “We shouldn’t need to make a choice between feeding people and reducing carbon emissions,” House said. “It’s thinking about the way we use land and we govern things around that to give people access to the food they need.” ",Land degradation accelerates global climate change,land-degradation-accelerates-global-climate-change,44:55.0,32:01.2,"An IPCC report has suggested that better land management and healthier diets can help address climate change.

"Desertification or land degradation already affects more than 500 million people in the world’s poorest countries. London, United Kingdom –  Better land management and the consumption of healthier diets can help address climate change, says the first comprehensive study on the interactions linking land and climate systems. Climate Change and Land , published on Thursday by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) –  the UN agency responsible for assessing climate change science – looks at the role land use can play in contributing to or mitigating global warming. However, the agency points out that sustainable land use is only one aspect of a strategy that should aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors in order to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. That deal, signed in 2015 by more than 200 countries, aimed to limit global warming to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels while pursuing efforts to limit the rise to 1.5C. “Land is undergoing human pressure, land is part of the solution, but land cannot do it all,” Debra Roberts, one of the authors of the report and cochair of the working group assessing climate effect and adaptation told journalists at a news conference in Geneva. While land use, including forestry and agriculture, accounts for at least 23 percent of human greenhouse gas emissions, land is also able to absorb nearly a third of emissions from fossil fuels and industry. 
				We have a lot of choice about the way we manage land in the future, the diet that we eat, and these choices can have large impacts			 
				 by  Joanna House, IPCC report author			 “We need to look at how we can reduce emissions from land and how we can use it to cause carbon removal,” Joanna House, one of the report’s lead authors and a reader in environmental science and policy at the University of Bristol, told Al Jazeera. “We have a lot of choice about the way we manage land in the future, the diet that we eat, and these choices can have large impacts,” she added. “It’s all about the choices people and governments make moving forward. What is clear is we need urgent action now across all sectors. Not just reducing emissions from land, but from energy, and to avoid the climate impact on land.” The report addresses land degradation, caused by unprecedented rates of land and freshwater use due to population growth as well as changes in the consumption of food, timber and energy. “We humans affect more than 70 percent of ice-free land. A quarter of this land is degraded,” said Valerie Masson-Delmotte, cochair of the IPCC’s working group addressing the physical science basis on climate change. “The way we produce food and what we eat contributes to the loss of nature and ecosystems and declining biodiversity. When land is degraded, it reduces the soil’s ability to take up carbon, and this exacerbates climate change. In turn, climate change exacerbates land degradation.” More than 500 million people currently live in areas that already experience desertification or degradation, mostly in the world’s poorest countries, which are also the most exposed to food insecurity. “The countries that are most food insecure are the ones that have done the least to cause the climate problem, and part of that is a question about geography,” Katherine Kramer, global climate lead at Christian Aid, which released a report on climate change and food security earlier this week, told Al Jazeera. 					 
				 		 “Certain parts of the world are warming much more rapidly and are much more prone to have extreme weather events,” she continued. “These tend to be in the poorest countries and of course the impact will be greater there because they have the least resilience to be able to cope.” The IPCC report stresses the importance of reducing food waste. Between 2010 and 2016, global food loss and waste contributed between eight and 10 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions produced by human activities. Between 25 and 30 percent of the food we produce is currently lost or wasted. “Underlying this report is the fact that a relatively small number of giant meat, agribusiness and biofuel companies are responsible for the bulk of deforestation and other climate pollution in the agriculture sector,” said Glenn Hurowitz, CEO of global campaign group Mighty Earth. A shift towards low-carbon diets – eating less meat and more plant-based foods such as grains, vegetables and nuts – is also among the recommendations. “Changing dietary practices [can help] free up land that we can then use for sustainable food production or carbon mitigation in other ways,” House said. “We shouldn’t need to make a choice between feeding people and reducing carbon emissions,” House said. “It’s thinking about the way we use land and we govern things around that to give people access to the food they need.” ",Land degradation accelerates global climate change,land-degradation-accelerates-global-climate-change,44:55.0,32:01.2,"An IPCC report has suggested that better land management and healthier diets can help address climate change.

"An EU net zero carbon footprint by 2050 target was scuppered by four governments, dependent on fossil fuel economies. London, United Kingdom –  European Union leaders have failed to strike a deal to commit the bloc to achieving climate neutrality by 2050 at a European Council summit this week. While only eight countries had committed to the target at the previous summit in March, large-scale environmental protests and the huge gains made by green parties at the European elections in May had raised expectations of a breakthrough. Several European leaders had backed the target, b ut four countries – Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Hungary – blocked the proposal on Thursday amid concerns it would hurt their economies, which are dependent on nuclear power and coal. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told reporters in Brussels: “Poland … must first have very detailed compensation packages. We must know how much we can get for modernization.” As unanimity is required among member states to pass the deal, the 2050 goal was not included in the EU’s strategic agenda  for 2019-2024. The target would commit the EU to a net zero carbon footprint by 2050 by reducing emissions from transport, homes, and industrial or other economic activity, or offsetting them with projects aimed at soaking up CO2 or avoiding future emissions. 					 
				 		 The European Commission presented the plan in late November, writing that it should include “ investing into realistic technological solutions, empowering citizens, and aligning action in key areas such as industrial policy, finance, or research – while ensuring social fairness for a just transition.” The plan would make the EU the world’s first major economy to commit to going climate neutral ahead of a key UN conference in New York on September 25. “It is incumbent on the EU ahead of the summit in September to make an agreement on the 2050 target to ensure the EU is showing leadership and the world is on a path to achieving net zero given the scale of the challenges we face on the climate emergency,” Luke Murphy, who heads the Environmental Justice Commission at the Institute for Public Policy Research, told Al Jazeera. “ Of course it’s right that there needs to be a focus on the economic and social justice policies that need to be implemented, but that is essentially what should have been agreed at this summit,” Murphy added. Environmental campaigning group Greenpeace EU has called  on European leaders to hold an emergency climate summit before the UN meeting in New York and to recognise the need to step up current targets.  The European Council’s conclusions  dropped the 2050 deadline, instead reiterating a commitment to the 2016 Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels while pursuing efforts to limit the rise to 1.5 degrees. It pledged to issue its guidance by the end of the year for a strategy to be adopted in early 2020 “that will preserve European competitiveness, be just and socially balanced, take account of Member States’ national circumstances and respect their right to decide on their own energy mix.”  This will likely coincide with the EU’s long-term budget negotiations. Martin Nesbit, head of the Climate and Environmental Governance Programme at the Institute for European Environmental Policy, argues that there has to be greater conditionality between budget decisions and the willingness of member states to sign up to the 2050 target. “Member states need to move to a slightly firmer position in the negotiations and say that significant elements of cohesion spending in the states that are blocking the 2050 target will be withheld unless they agree to it,” Nesbit told Al Jazeera, arguing that developed economies like the EU would need to make the commitment for developing countries to follow suit. “I’d say China has a more developed policy on greenhouse gas emissions than Poland does. There’s often an exaggeration of the unwillingness of countries like China and India to take action,” he added. A group of European researchers warned this week that global emissions would need to be halved by 2030 to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. According to the Climate Action Tracker ( CAT ), most governments are not taking enough action with only The Gambia and Morocco being on track to meet that goal. “Emissions keep rising and impacts are being felt all around the world, with developing countries experiencing the brunt of these impacts,” said Bill Hare of Climate Analytics. “Recent examples include devastating floods and loss of life in East Africa caused by Tropical Cyclone Idai and record 50 degree C temperatures in India.”  While the leaders of the EU’s 28 member states fell short of agreeing on the proposed target in Brussels, thousands of youth took to the streets for the fifth global climate strike on Friday. Schoolchildren and teenagers have been walking out of school to demand government action to tackle climate change.  The first global climate strike on March 15 drew an estimated 1.5 million students to the streets in more than 100 countries. It helped propel the Extinction Rebellion protests, which brought parts of London to a halt and led to the British government declaring a climate emergency. The UK has committed to going climate neutral by 2050. After Europe-wide elections in May, the Greens became the fourth-largest group in the 751-seat European Parliament, due to hold its first plenary session on July 2. Green parties emerged as a leading political force in Germany and nearly doubled their share of the vote in France, the United Kingdom, Finland and Denmark. “The benefits of committing to the target are greater the sooner the decision is made, in economic as well as environmental terms,” Nesbit said. “It is challenging but feasible. The sooner the investor and the private sector have clarity on what the target is, the easier it is to meet that target,” he added, explaining that businesses need to know how carbon restrictions will change in order to invest in the appropriate technology. “T here are huge opportunities from the green transition. In terms of green jobs, green manufacturing, being able to export goods in this low-carbon economy,” Murphy said. “Whatever pace we are moving, we are moving towards that.” “It’s not just government and green groups. Businesses were disappointed by the decision as well. Actually, there is huge support in the UK for the net zero target from the business community as there is across the EU because they welcome stability.” ",EU leaders fail to show united front on climate change,eu-leaders-fail-to-show-united-front-on-climate-change,30:22.0,32:04.8,"Leaders at a European Council summit this week failed to secure a deal committing the EU to achieving climate neutrality by 2050, after objections by Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Hungary, which have fossil fuel economies.

Martin Nesbit, head of the Climate and Environmental Governance Programme at the Institute for European Environmental Policy, argues that there has to be greater conditionality between budget decisions and the willingness of member states to sign up to the 2050 target. “Member states need to move to a slightly firmer position in the negotiations and say that significant elements of cohesion spending in the states that are blocking the 2050 target will be withheld unless they agree to it,” Nesbit told Al Jazeera, arguing that developed economies like the EU would need to make the commitment for developing countries to follow suit. “I’d say China has a more developed policy on greenhouse gas emissions than Poland does. There’s often an exaggeration of the unwillingness of countries like China and India to take action,” he added. A group of European researchers warned this week that global emissions would need to be halved by 2030 to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. According to the Climate Action Tracker ( CAT ), most governments are not taking enough action with only The Gambia and Morocco being on track to meet that goal. “Emissions keep rising and impacts are being felt all around the world, with developing countries experiencing the brunt of these impacts,” said Bill Hare of Climate Analytics. “Recent examples include devastating floods and loss of life in East Africa caused by Tropical Cyclone Idai and record 50 degree C temperatures in India.”  While the leaders of the EU’s 28 member states fell short of agreeing on the proposed target in Brussels, thousands of youth took to the streets for the fifth global climate strike on Friday. Schoolchildren and teenagers have been walking out of school to demand government action to tackle climate change.  The first global climate strike on March 15 drew an estimated 1.5 million students to the streets in more than 100 countries. It helped propel the Extinction Rebellion protests, which brought parts of London to a halt and led to the British government declaring a climate emergency.

Green parties emerged as a leading political force in Germany and nearly doubled their share of the vote in France, the United Kingdom, Finland and Denmark. “The benefits of committing to the target are greater the sooner the decision is made, in economic as well as environmental terms,” Nesbit said. “It is challenging but feasible. The sooner the investor and the private sector have clarity on what the target is, the easier it is to meet that target,” he added, explaining that businesses need to know how carbon restrictions will change in order to invest in the appropriate technology. “T here are huge opportunities from the green transition. In terms of green jobs, green manufacturing, being able to export goods in this low-carbon economy,” Murphy said. “Whatever pace we are moving, we are moving towards that.” “It’s not just government and green groups. Businesses were disappointed by the decision as well.

"An EU net zero carbon footprint by 2050 target was scuppered by four governments, dependent on fossil fuel economies. London, United Kingdom –  European Union leaders have failed to strike a deal to commit the bloc to achieving climate neutrality by 2050 at a European Council summit this week. While only eight countries had committed to the target at the previous summit in March, large-scale environmental protests and the huge gains made by green parties at the European elections in May had raised expectations of a breakthrough. Several European leaders had backed the target, b ut four countries – Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Hungary – blocked the proposal on Thursday amid concerns it would hurt their economies, which are dependent on nuclear power and coal. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told reporters in Brussels: “Poland … must first have very detailed compensation packages.

Several European leaders had backed the target, b ut four countries – Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Hungary – blocked the proposal on Thursday amid concerns it would hurt their economies, which are dependent on nuclear power and coal. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told reporters in Brussels: “Poland … must first have very detailed compensation packages. We must know how much we can get for modernization.” As unanimity is required among member states to pass the deal, the 2050 goal was not included in the EU’s strategic agenda  for 2019-2024. The target would commit the EU to a net zero carbon footprint by 2050 by reducing emissions from transport, homes, and industrial or other economic activity, or offsetting them with projects aimed at soaking up CO2 or avoiding future emissions. 					 
				 		 The European Commission presented the plan in late November, writing that it should include “ investing into realistic technological solutions, empowering citizens, and aligning action in key areas such as industrial policy, finance, or research – while ensuring social fairness for a just transition.” The plan would make the EU the world’s first major economy to commit to going climate neutral ahead of a key UN conference in New York on September 25. “It is incumbent on the EU ahead of the summit in September to make an agreement on the 2050 target to ensure the EU is showing leadership and the world is on a path to achieving net zero given the scale of the challenges we face on the climate emergency,” Luke Murphy, who heads the Environmental Justice Commission at the Institute for Public Policy Research, told Al Jazeera. “ Of course it’s right that there needs to be a focus on the economic and social justice policies that need to be implemented, but that is essentially what should have been agreed at this summit,” Murphy added. Environmental campaigning group Greenpeace EU has called  on European leaders to hold an emergency climate summit before the UN meeting in New York and to recognise the need to step up current targets.  The European Council’s conclusions  dropped the 2050 deadline, instead reiterating a commitment to the 2016 Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels while pursuing efforts to limit the rise to 1.5 degrees. It pledged to issue its guidance by the end of the year for a strategy to be adopted in early 2020 “that will preserve European competitiveness, be just and socially balanced, take account of Member States’ national circumstances and respect their right to decide on their own energy mix.”  This will likely coincide with the EU’s long-term budget negotiations. Martin Nesbit, head of the Climate and Environmental Governance Programme at the Institute for European Environmental Policy, argues that there has to be greater conditionality between budget decisions and the willingness of member states to sign up to the 2050 target. “Member states need to move to a slightly firmer position in the negotiations and say that significant elements of cohesion spending in the states that are blocking the 2050 target will be withheld unless they agree to it,” Nesbit told Al Jazeera, arguing that developed economies like the EU would need to make the commitment for developing countries to follow suit. “I’d say China has a more developed policy on greenhouse gas emissions than Poland does. There’s often an exaggeration of the unwillingness of countries like China and India to take action,” he added. A group of European researchers warned this week that global emissions would need to be halved by 2030 to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. According to the Climate Action Tracker ( CAT ), most governments are not taking enough action with only The Gambia and Morocco being on track to meet that goal. “Emissions keep rising and impacts are being felt all around the world, with developing countries experiencing the brunt of these impacts,” said Bill Hare of Climate Analytics. “Recent examples include devastating floods and loss of life in East Africa caused by Tropical Cyclone Idai and record 50 degree C temperatures in India.”  While the leaders of the EU’s 28 member states fell short of agreeing on the proposed target in Brussels, thousands of youth took to the streets for the fifth global climate strike on Friday. Schoolchildren and teenagers have been walking out of school to demand government action to tackle climate change.  The first global climate strike on March 15 drew an estimated 1.5 million students to the streets in more than 100 countries. It helped propel the Extinction Rebellion protests, which brought parts of London to a halt and led to the British government declaring a climate emergency. The UK has committed to going climate neutral by 2050. After Europe-wide elections in May, the Greens became the fourth-largest group in the 751-seat European Parliament, due to hold its first plenary session on July 2. Green parties emerged as a leading political force in Germany and nearly doubled their share of the vote in France, the United Kingdom, Finland and Denmark. “The benefits of committing to the target are greater the sooner the decision is made, in economic as well as environmental terms,” Nesbit said. “It is challenging but feasible. The sooner the investor and the private sector have clarity on what the target is, the easier it is to meet that target,” he added, explaining that businesses need to know how carbon restrictions will change in order to invest in the appropriate technology. “T here are huge opportunities from the green transition. In terms of green jobs, green manufacturing, being able to export goods in this low-carbon economy,” Murphy said. “Whatever pace we are moving, we are moving towards that.” “It’s not just government and green groups. Businesses were disappointed by the decision as well. Actually, there is huge support in the UK for the net zero target from the business community as there is across the EU because they welcome stability.” ",EU leaders fail to show united front on climate change,eu-leaders-fail-to-show-united-front-on-climate-change,30:22.0,32:04.8,"Leaders at a European Council summit this week failed to secure a deal committing the EU to achieving climate neutrality by 2050, after objections by Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Hungary, which have fossil fuel economies.

"An EU net zero carbon footprint by 2050 target was scuppered by four governments, dependent on fossil fuel economies. London, United Kingdom –  European Union leaders have failed to strike a deal to commit the bloc to achieving climate neutrality by 2050 at a European Council summit this week. While only eight countries had committed to the target at the previous summit in March, large-scale environmental protests and the huge gains made by green parties at the European elections in May had raised expectations of a breakthrough. Several European leaders had backed the target, b ut four countries – Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Hungary – blocked the proposal on Thursday amid concerns it would hurt their economies, which are dependent on nuclear power and coal. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told reporters in Brussels: “Poland … must first have very detailed compensation packages. We must know how much we can get for modernization.” As unanimity is required among member states to pass the deal, the 2050 goal was not included in the EU’s strategic agenda  for 2019-2024. The target would commit the EU to a net zero carbon footprint by 2050 by reducing emissions from transport, homes, and industrial or other economic activity, or offsetting them with projects aimed at soaking up CO2 or avoiding future emissions. 					 
				 		 The European Commission presented the plan in late November, writing that it should include “ investing into realistic technological solutions, empowering citizens, and aligning action in key areas such as industrial policy, finance, or research – while ensuring social fairness for a just transition.” The plan would make the EU the world’s first major economy to commit to going climate neutral ahead of a key UN conference in New York on September 25. “It is incumbent on the EU ahead of the summit in September to make an agreement on the 2050 target to ensure the EU is showing leadership and the world is on a path to achieving net zero given the scale of the challenges we face on the climate emergency,” Luke Murphy, who heads the Environmental Justice Commission at the Institute for Public Policy Research, told Al Jazeera. “ Of course it’s right that there needs to be a focus on the economic and social justice policies that need to be implemented, but that is essentially what should have been agreed at this summit,” Murphy added. Environmental campaigning group Greenpeace EU has called  on European leaders to hold an emergency climate summit before the UN meeting in New York and to recognise the need to step up current targets.  The European Council’s conclusions  dropped the 2050 deadline, instead reiterating a commitment to the 2016 Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels while pursuing efforts to limit the rise to 1.5 degrees. It pledged to issue its guidance by the end of the year for a strategy to be adopted in early 2020 “that will preserve European competitiveness, be just and socially balanced, take account of Member States’ national circumstances and respect their right to decide on their own energy mix.”  This will likely coincide with the EU’s long-term budget negotiations. Martin Nesbit, head of the Climate and Environmental Governance Programme at the Institute for European Environmental Policy, argues that there has to be greater conditionality between budget decisions and the willingness of member states to sign up to the 2050 target. “Member states need to move to a slightly firmer position in the negotiations and say that significant elements of cohesion spending in the states that are blocking the 2050 target will be withheld unless they agree to it,” Nesbit told Al Jazeera, arguing that developed economies like the EU would need to make the commitment for developing countries to follow suit. “I’d say China has a more developed policy on greenhouse gas emissions than Poland does. There’s often an exaggeration of the unwillingness of countries like China and India to take action,” he added. A group of European researchers warned this week that global emissions would need to be halved by 2030 to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. According to the Climate Action Tracker ( CAT ), most governments are not taking enough action with only The Gambia and Morocco being on track to meet that goal. “Emissions keep rising and impacts are being felt all around the world, with developing countries experiencing the brunt of these impacts,” said Bill Hare of Climate Analytics. “Recent examples include devastating floods and loss of life in East Africa caused by Tropical Cyclone Idai and record 50 degree C temperatures in India.”  While the leaders of the EU’s 28 member states fell short of agreeing on the proposed target in Brussels, thousands of youth took to the streets for the fifth global climate strike on Friday. Schoolchildren and teenagers have been walking out of school to demand government action to tackle climate change.  The first global climate strike on March 15 drew an estimated 1.5 million students to the streets in more than 100 countries. It helped propel the Extinction Rebellion protests, which brought parts of London to a halt and led to the British government declaring a climate emergency. The UK has committed to going climate neutral by 2050. After Europe-wide elections in May, the Greens became the fourth-largest group in the 751-seat European Parliament, due to hold its first plenary session on July 2. Green parties emerged as a leading political force in Germany and nearly doubled their share of the vote in France, the United Kingdom, Finland and Denmark. “The benefits of committing to the target are greater the sooner the decision is made, in economic as well as environmental terms,” Nesbit said. “It is challenging but feasible. The sooner the investor and the private sector have clarity on what the target is, the easier it is to meet that target,” he added, explaining that businesses need to know how carbon restrictions will change in order to invest in the appropriate technology. “T here are huge opportunities from the green transition.

According to the Climate Action Tracker ( CAT ), most governments are not taking enough action with only The Gambia and Morocco being on track to meet that goal. “Emissions keep rising and impacts are being felt all around the world, with developing countries experiencing the brunt of these impacts,” said Bill Hare of Climate Analytics. “Recent examples include devastating floods and loss of life in East Africa caused by Tropical Cyclone Idai and record 50 degree C temperatures in India.”  While the leaders of the EU’s 28 member states fell short of agreeing on the proposed target in Brussels, thousands of youth took to the streets for the fifth global climate strike on Friday. Schoolchildren and teenagers have been walking out of school to demand government action to tackle climate change.  The first global climate strike on March 15 drew an estimated 1.5 million students to the streets in more than 100 countries. It helped propel the Extinction Rebellion protests, which brought parts of London to a halt and led to the British government declaring a climate emergency. The UK has committed to going climate neutral by 2050. After Europe-wide elections in May, the Greens became the fourth-largest group in the 751-seat European Parliament, due to hold its first plenary session on July 2. Green parties emerged as a leading political force in Germany and nearly doubled their share of the vote in France, the United Kingdom, Finland and Denmark. “The benefits of committing to the target are greater the sooner the decision is made, in economic as well as environmental terms,” Nesbit said. “It is challenging but feasible. The sooner the investor and the private sector have clarity on what the target is, the easier it is to meet that target,” he added, explaining that businesses need to know how carbon restrictions will change in order to invest in the appropriate technology. “T here are huge opportunities from the green transition. In terms of green jobs, green manufacturing, being able to export goods in this low-carbon economy,” Murphy said. “Whatever pace we are moving, we are moving towards that.” “It’s not just government and green groups. Businesses were disappointed by the decision as well. Actually, there is huge support in the UK for the net zero target from the business community as there is across the EU because they welcome stability.” ",EU leaders fail to show united front on climate change,eu-leaders-fail-to-show-united-front-on-climate-change,30:22.0,32:04.8,"Leaders at a European Council summit this week failed to secure a deal committing the EU to achieving climate neutrality by 2050, after objections by Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Hungary, which have fossil fuel economies.

"Carbon emissions blamed for Australia’s hotter and drier condition, increasing the risk of more droughts and bushfires. Australia’s government is in no rush to sign up to a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, although it recognises the importance of working towards that goal, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in an interview published on Saturday. Morrison’s conservative government, in a surprise change of policy last month, said it would achieve its 2030 carbon emissions pledge under the Paris climate agreement without counting carbon credits from over-achieving on its previous climate targets. But in an interview with The Australian newspaper, Morrison said he will not take a new 2030 or 2035 emissions reduction target to a key United Nations climate conference in Glasgow in November. “It is about whether you can produce hydrogen at the right cost, it is about whether [carbon capture and storage] can be done at the right cost, it is whether we can produce low emissions steel and aluminium at the right cost,” the newspaper quoted Morrison as saying. “That is how you actually get to net zero. You don’t get there by just having some commitment. That is where the discussion has to go, and I think the [US President Joe] Biden administration provides an opportunity to really pursue that with some enthusiasm.” 		 					 
				 		 Australia’s emissions are now projected to be 29 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, compared with its Paris accord target of cutting carbon emissions by between 26 and 28 percent, based on recent growth in renewable energy and what could be achieved under an 18-billion-Australian-dollar ($14bn) technology investment plan the government outlined in September. “We all want to get there,” Morrison said. “It is not about the politics any more, it is about the technology.” He added that the timeline to commit to a zero-net-emissions target will depend on “where the science is at and where our assessment is based on the technologies”. According to the latest climate report from the country’s weather bureau published in November, Australia is expected become hotter and drier, increasing the risk of drought and extreme weather events such as the bushfires that devastated swaths of its southeastern region in 2019. 		 					 
				 		 The Bureau of Meteorology (BoM)’s latest State of the Climate report blames carbon emissions for the increase in extreme heat, noting that a hotter Australia will affect the lives and livelihoods of everyone who lives there. Australia’s climate has warmed on average by 1.44 degrees Celsius since national records began in 1910, the report said. The country experienced its warmest year on record in 2019, and the seven years from 2013 to 2019 all ranked among the nine warmest years ever, the BoM said. Australia as a whole is also reporting more “extremely warm” days with 43 reported in 2019, more than triple the number in any of the years prior to 2000.

"Kamala Harris makes history as US vice presidential candidate, but barriers remain for women in power around the world. When Satsuki Katayama was appointed as the sole female minister in Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s new cabinet in 2018, she immediately came face-to-face with the practical obstacles facing women in leadership positions. Just before the declaration ceremony to mark the new government, Katayama was informed she was not dressed correctly for the occasion. Imperial Palace dress code stipulates that women must wear long dresses. So while the men spent the time before the ceremony relaxing and schmoozing with their fellow parliamentarians, Katayama hastily rushed out to find a more suitable outfit – just because she is a woman. It is easy to dismiss such incidents as small annoyances, but when they occur on a daily basis they act as roadblocks and barriers to women assuming leadership positions. While women have made strides, particularly in advanced capitalist societies, this is still a new game for them – especially women of colour. This week, US Democratic party presidential candidate Joe Biden announced that Senator Kamala Harris would be his running mate and future vice president if he wins the vote this November. This is frontier stuff – it is the first time a woman of colour has been given such a position on a major party ticket in the US. To some, this highlights how patriarchal the system remains as she had to have it bestowed upon her by a man – Biden. It remains to be seen if this is a real marker for progress, or a tokenistic effort on the part of the Democrats. The fact is that the obstacles preventing most women from reaching positions of power remain firmly in place. Dress codes, such as the one encountered by Katayama, are not the only thing to hamper women in parliaments around the world. Between 2004 and 2014, Silvana Koch-Mehrin served as a German Member of the European Parliament in Brussels. During that time, she became pregnant, gave birth and discovered that there were no facilities for women to care for babies, such as private areas where they might breastfeed or change nappies. Unless they were happy to do these things on full display in meetings or in the chamber, women would be unable to carry out their parliamentary duties shortly after giving birth. “It was one of those requirements which are just not on the horizons of men,” she says now. “I could have just used my office to breastfeed but it is a parliament with many people working there, not just MEPs. Not all of them have private offices.” Thanks in part to her own campaign, these facilities have since been installed for women in the European Parliament, where female participation has slowly but steadily risen every year since its first elections in 1979. During her time as a politician and in parliaments around the world, Koch-Mehrin observed many direct and indirect obstacles to true equal participation. The Italian Parliament, for example, only recently removed the privilege for male parliamentarians to receive free haircuts. “It is a small symbolic element,” she says. But it sums up some of the inequalities that women face. While men got their hair cut on the spot during working hours, women had to take time out of their parliamentary duties to visit a hair salon – a distraction from their work and, therefore, a disadvantage. As a result of what she learned during her time as a female parliamentarian, Koch-Mehrin now heads up the Reykjavik-based Women Political Leaders (WPL) global network of female politicians. The independent organisation has a mission to increase the number and influence of women in political leadership positions, and over the past decade, its research has highlighted the many non-legal barriers women still face. “It is quite astonishing to see that more than 100 years after women were first given the right to vote (in Iceland), the first-ever elected woman president is still alive,” says Koch-Mehrin. She is speaking of Vigdis Finnbogadottir who won the 1980 Icelandic presidential election and became the longest-serving elected female head of state in history, with nearly 16 years in office. Iceland is far from the norm, of course. Despite some countries having had female heads of state before Finnbogadottir came to office, and since, the number of nations that have broken through the gender barrier to elect a woman leader is markedly low. The US, for one, is still struggling to get there. “It is still a new phenomenon in political systems which have been set up and tailored to the needs of men for hundreds of years,” says Koch-Mehrin. “Women are still the ‘new’ group trying to get in.” The climb to the top is even more fraught for women of colour, even in political systems which have made traction in the effort to ease the passage of women generally. In strongly multicultural societies such as the US and the United Kingdom, the evidence of this is especially marked. Take, for example, the racial and misogynistic abuse suffered by female politicians of colour in the UK. Diane Abbott is a former shadow Home Secretary in the UK. According to research by Amnesty International, she received nearly half  – 45 percent – of all the abusive tweets sent to female MPs in the run-up to the general election in June 2017. 
				Women of colour, and Black women in particular, have to work twice as hard to show they are qualified.			 
				 by  Amanda Hunter			 The Amnesty researcher, Azmina Dhrodia, said that deleted tweets could not be counted in this, so the true extent of the abuse was probably much worse. Even when Abbott was excluded from the total, Black and Asian female MPs were found to receive 35 percent more abusive tweets than their white peers. Amanda Hunter is head of research at the Barbara Lee Family Foundation in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which campaigns to advance women’s representation in US politics. She says: “In addition to facing gender bias, women of colour have to contend with racial bias on the campaign trail.” “Women candidates have to prove to voters they are up to the job. Women have to show they can get results, while men can simply release their resume.” “Women of colour, and Black women in particular, have to work twice as hard to show they are qualified, particularly on issues like economic credentials. Women of colour also seem to face more ‘electability’ doubts than their white male counterparts.” It has been 100 years since some women first won the vote and it is approaching 100 years since the first woman was elected to the House of Commons in the United Kingdom. Yet women remain significantly underrepresented there, making up only 32 percent of all MPs. “While progress has been made, a significant amount of work is still needed to ensure that parliament reflects a diverse range of voices,” says Sam Smethers, CEO of the Fawcett Society, a group which campaigns for women’s greater participation in public and the workplace in the UK. First, it is not true that legal barriers have been entirely removed for most women in most places, as the 2019  World Bank Business and Law report  illustrates.  The report scrutinises laws and regulations which may hinder women entering the workplace or starting businesses in 187 countries around the world, giving each a score out of 100, with the average being 74.71. These regulations range from legal rights to societal regulations, such as women being allowed to leave home without the permission of a male relative. It is clear from this research that the situation is more dire for women in some countries than others. 
				It is quite amazing to me that only six countries are treating men and women equally in the law.			 
				 by  Silvana Koch-Mehrin			 Until last year, women in Saudi Arabia were subject to the country’s strict guardianship law, which required women to seek permission from a male relative in matters of work, leisure, finances, law and health. This was relaxed last year and women may now obtain a passport and travel without the permission of a male relative, and some workplace discrimination protections have been implemented. Still, Saudi remains at the bottom of the index with a score of just 25.63. While the playing field remains far from even in sub-Saharan African countries and South-East Asia, these are in fact, where the greatest improvements have taken place over the past 10 years. Sub-Saharan Africa had the third-highest increase in the average regional score, moving from 64.04 to 69.63 over the decade. South Asia was where the greatest regional rise was observed, moving from 50 to 58.36. This was followed by East Asia and the Pacific, which went from 64.8 to 70.73. The report stated: “Most top reformers introduced sexual harassment laws or mandated non-discrimination in access to credit. One-third of the top reforming economies removed job restrictions on night work or on certain job types.” Only six countries – Belgium, Denmark, France, Latvia, Luxembourg and Sweden – score the full 100 marks in the Women, Business and Law Index. None of them scored 100 10 years ago, however, indicating that there has been some progress at least. France has made the most progress in this time, going from a score of 91.88 in the index in 2009 to 100 in 2019, by implementing domestic violence laws, providing criminal penalties for workplace sexual harassment and introducing paid parental leave. “It is quite amazing to me that only six countries are treating men and women equally in the law,” says Koch-Mehrin. “It is very much a systemic problem.” Practical issues like dress codes and a lack of facilities for mothers are elements that impede women. “The problem is the way the system works,” says Smethers. “If you’ve got a family and kids at school and you are juggling the commute to parliament, then women are less able to nurse a seat.” Much of this is down to the expectations placed on women by society generally – the phenomenon termed the “Second Shift” in the US and “Wifework” in the UK, after the books by the same names by Arlie Hochschild and Susan Maushart respectively. Anthony Pahnke, an associate professor in international relations at San Francisco University, where he also focuses on political leaders in the US and Latin America, attributes this as the main issue facing women in advanced capitalist societies. 
				In the US workforce, women are immigrants. And politics remains a man's realm.			 
				 by  Anthony Pahnke			 “Since women have entered the workforce, they have ended up having two jobs,” he says. “Women’s roles have changed in the outside world, but they are still seen as being responsible for the home.” “I always have students who say ‘that’s an old way of thinking’, but it’s not. It shows up all the time in people’s opinions.” “In the US workforce, women are immigrants. And politics remains a man’s realm.” In 2014, WPL carried out a global study on the non-legal barriers that hamper the careers of women business and political leaders. “We looked at why, despite companies giving the same particular rights to men and women, in the majority of countries we still don’t get the same level of participation. It is the same throughout the world,” Koch-Mehrin says. “The question is not exclusive to politics at all. It is a combination of having family and work and the assumption that it is for the woman to find the solutions. The question of managing home and work is not asked in any way of men.” Furthermore, she says, women have to gain the approval of their families before they can even begin to try juggling the two. “Women are still seeking the consent and permission of their families. This is a question men do not have to worry about in most cases.” In 2018, The Fawcett Society conducted  research  into how parliamentary candidates are selected by political parties in the UK. “Overwhelmingly across the political parties, we found that those doing the selecting had a very rigid idea of an ideal candidate in their minds – and this was overwhelmingly a white, middle-class man,” says Smethers. “So, when they meet women candidates, they are already not ‘what they had in mind’.” “We had lots of quotes from women about being asked about their childcare arrangements and who would look after the household. The idea that they might have a spouse who could accommodate that is just not entertained.” Social stereotypes, therefore, are very much at play. “Men are just assumed to be qualified,” says Hunter. “Women have to prove they are qualified over and over. So, it is important for them to showcase that they can get results and to highlight their successes.” “Women have to be over-prepared. There is no room for mistakes.” She believes this is the reason that several countries with women leaders have fared better with the coronavirus pandemic, for example, about which there has been a great deal of media attention. Women simply cannot afford to get it wrong. In New Zealand , for example, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has been praised for her sympathetic communications style and for the fact that the country’s coronavirus peak was in April while there have been only 22 deaths in a population of five million. “When women run for governor, in addition to running an election campaign, we have to run a campaign of belief. Men don’t have to do that. It is because of the stereotype that women are not as qualified.” In 2018, WPL launched its Reykjavik Index of G7 and BRIC countries, examining the way that women are viewed and stereotyped when it comes to being chosen as political leaders. “We found the stereotype is strongly that women are less suitable for positions of leadership. It is a combination of this and the unequal starting positions that means we are not there yet,” Koch-Mehrin says. Research undertaken by the Barbara Lee Family Foundation strongly supports this finding. “When we researched this, the voters we talked to acknowledged that women were being held to a higher level of account,” Hunter says. 
				For women, ambition is a four-letter word. It is very threatening to some people.			 
				 by  Amanda Hunter			 As a result, women candidates tend to hold themselves to a higher account as well. “We researched candidates and found that although men and women reported consuming the same amount of media, women were still three times as likely to say they did not feel informed enough [to make executive leadership decisions about important issues].” “For women, ambition is a four-letter word. It is very threatening to some people. But women are starting to stand up for each other and for themselves,” she adds. In his work on political leaders in the US and Latin America, Pahnke has found a common theme – the assumption that women can’t “do” economics. “There has been a lot of research about the obstacles women face in politics both here and in Latin America that I have studied,” he says. “It seems that when politics becomes economics, women candidates do poorly. “There is a lot of inequality in the US and also in 2016 [at the time of the last presidential election], trade was a major issue. It was not just the connection between Hillary Clinton and NAFTA, but there was also the gender issue and this idea that women can’t do economics.” He believes this is one of the reasons Elizabeth Warren’s bid to be the Democratic presidential candidate was unsuccessful. “There is no issue with Elizabeth Warren’s competence,” he says. “Her camp issued many policy statements on everything from agriculture to banking and asking people for ideas about food and farming. She would have been a great president. “Take the Medicare For All issue. Bernie [Sanders] gave no answers about this. Warren did give answers and dropped in the ratings, because there is a blindness about women’s ability to manage the economy.” While people are far more accepting of women in local politics, says Smethers, there is also a blindness about their suitability for national leadership. “The public will vote for them at the local level,” she says. “There is data that shows the public say they want to see women in politics because they feel they will represent them better. But when it is higher up, they are more exposed and, if they don’t look and sound like macho men, they aren’t taken as seriously.” This is compounded by the fact that women have limited access to finance and networks when it comes to promoting themselves for leadership positions. In the US, for example, the system is deeply patriarchal in the way it operates with family political dynasties and access to wealth, says Hunter. “A lot of the positions in Congress and the Senate have become family positions … and it is extremely important to have financial support.” Koch-Mehrin adds: “We well know that women don’t get the same access to and share of donors and finances for campaigns. Political parties give less to women candidates.” As a result of all these factors, women also face a lot more abuse when they do take public office – yet another deterrent to taking prominent positions in public life. The fact is that large sections of society remain vehemently opposed to women in public life. According to figures from the United Nations and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), more than 80 percent of women parliamentarians report having been the target of online harassment and abuse. This ranges from quips about their attractiveness all the way to physical violence – sometimes fatal, as in the case of the UK MP Jo Cox who was shot and stabbed to death in 2016 by a far-right activist. In 2018, the Brazilian politician Marielle Franco was murdered in similar circumstances in her car. In that case, the two murder suspects had previously been photographed with the country’s president, Jair Bolsonaro. Both women had endured campaigns of online abuse as well. “Online harassment and abuse are so bad for women, with death threats and rape threats. This is a massive deterrent to women from taking part in politics,” says Smethers. “Women have a very tough time in public life. Everything about them is micro-analysed – whether they are married, have children etc – and the scrutiny can be tiring and threatening,” adds Koch-Mehrin. Such scrutiny is also hugely distracting and time-wasting for women who should be free to direct their attention to their work and candidacies, says Hunter, setting them at yet another disadvantage not faced by their male peers. “When you look at women senators – this is a very good example of one of the obstacles that women face – they pay a much higher price if they make a mistake.” Senator Kamala Harris, the California Democrat who announced she was running as a presidential candidate last year – and who is now running for vice president alongside Joe Biden – was roasted after saying in a light-hearted interview that she listened to rap artists like Tupac and Snoop Dogg while she smoked cannabis in college, when in fact, the albums she referred to were released after she had graduated. “She ended up having to defend that mistake for days afterwards, which distracts from her political aims,” says Hunter. “Men can just laugh off such gaffes, but women have to defend themselves.” Women are held to standards that men do not have to meet. In 2019, for example, Politico ran an article entitled “Warren battles the ghosts of Hillary” and tweeted it out with the comment: “How does Elizabeth Warren avoid a Clinton redux – written off as too unlikeable before her campaign gets off the ground?” “Asking whether she was ‘likeable’ enough – there was a huge social media response of outrage driven by women to that,” says Hunter. “Women are totally fed up and just don’t want to put up with this blatant sexism anymore – even just four years after 2016 [when Hillary Clinton lost the presidential vote to Donald Trump].” Smethers points to the way women are objectified in the media as well. “You get the media talking about [First Minister of Scotland] Nicola Sturgeon’s legs and there is so much about what they wear.” The result is a very limited existence for women politicians unless they are brave enough to endure the abuse that results from putting their heads above the parapet, even just a little. Many of those who dismiss the idea that women face tough obstacles to leadership positions point to the one notable exception – Margaret Thatcher, who served as prime minister of the UK from 1979 to 1990. But, says Smethers and others who have studied her tenure, Thatcher achieved this by emulating a male style of leadership. “Margaret Thatcher had a very populist quality – council house sales, selling shares in British Gas. People felt they were on a journey of improving their lives. She played to the aspirations of people.” “But she had to show the men she could cut it. She couldn’t demonstrate any weakness. She was always across all the details – nothing ever got past her. Her power base was about her being the Iron Lady.” “She didn’t make it easy for women to follow her. She didn’t address the systemic barriers. She just operated within them.” By contrast, says Koch-Mehrin, Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany, has not merely stepped into the male template for political leaders. Instead of ruling with an iron fist or taking charge with “macho” decisiveness, Merkel has built her position on consensus and acceptance. “Angela Merkel knows how the system works,” says Koch-Mehrin. “Women tend to have a much shorter time in politics than men because of informal rules and backroom deals. These are not part of the official rule book and they are not available to women.” “Angela Merkel is different to this. She knows every single person in her party. She has worked with all the international leaders so she is acquainted with the unwritten rules.” “But she has a very different style to the men in her speeches. She doesn’t shout and take off her jacket to roll up her sleeves. She has a more analytical, less engaging way of speaking. She doesn’t throw her fist on the table. “Her style is weighing options and building a solid ground of consensus, which takes time. She gets people on board and then makes the decision. She is better at building consensus and collaborating.” “In the pictures of her at party congress, the media takes note of how many seats away from her people are placed. But she never says it herself.” “Her personal credibility is that she wants to serve. She lives in a modest apartment and she doesn’t go on billionaires’ yachts. She has a down-to-earth lifestyle unlike many male leaders.” Is the answer, therefore, for women to stop just trying to emulate men in order to get into positions of power? After all, doing so only results in one-off successes such as Margaret Thatcher, solving none of the obstacles faced generally by women. This is something which is finally starting to happen, says Hunter. “With millennial women, you can really see a change there. They have been very motivated by the #MeToo movement. Women are stepping up more than ever now.” Instead of just stepping into a male template, more women are starting to present themselves as full human beings – taking the “360 degrees approach”, as Hunter terms it. 
				Presidential elections can become referendums on masculinity.			 
				 by  Anthony Pahnke			 Hunter points to the example of Ayanna Pressley, the US Representative for Massachusetts Seventh Congressional district, and a woman of colour. “Ayanna Pressley is an example of a 360-degree candidate, as are many of the women who were elected to Congress in her class (post 2016). Instead of trying to fit into an outdated template that was created for a man, women are showing voters the whole of their human experience and how it will influence the way they lead.” For example, during her campaign, Pressley talked about having to work to pay for college as a way to show voters in her district she understood their financial challenges. She talked about being a survivor of sexual assault, and about having family members in the criminal justice system. Hunter says another good example of this is Senator Tammy Baldwin who ran an advert during her campaign about her mother’s addiction. Republican Senator Martha McSally is another woman who has talked about being a survivor of sexual assault. “By showing different sides of their lived experiences, women are demonstrating to voters they are in touch with the everyday challenges Americans face. We know from our  research , that this is very important. We saw this during the 2020 cycle when Elizabeth Warren talked about facing pregnancy discrimination, and Senator Harris talked about being bussed to school as a child.” Smethers adds that women leaders are starting to allow themselves to demonstrate different characteristics from men, such as lack of complacency, which may go some way to explain why some women leaders seem to have managed their countries’ experience of the coronavirus pandemic better than their male peers. “Male leaders can use a very macho style and a big weakness is complacency. Boris Johnson going out and shaking hands with people at a hospital, for example, shows a very cavalier approach. A lot of our leaders just didn’t take the pandemic seriously enough.” That is not a mistake most women leaders made – as can be seen by the way the pandemic was managed in New Zealand, Iceland, Germany and San Francisco among other places. “Second is the quality and style of communications,” says Smethers. “Women tend to be more open, more human and more reassuring. In New Zealand and Germany, you have got a different style of communicating with the country. It just feels like they care more.”  Unsurprisingly, the countries leading the way with women leaders are frequently those which have granted more access to women systemically. “Countries with women at the top have different systems,” says Hunter. “We have found that voters are open to supporting women to be part of a deliberative body. If that deliberative body then puts them into the leadership position and, once voters see them in that position, they are more likely to vote for them again.” According to Pahnke, parliamentary rather than presidential systems are more likely to facilitate this as well. “Presidential elections can become referendums on masculinity.” “In Germany and New Zealand, there are more opportunities for voters to express themselves through different party choices – there are more electoral choices,” he says. “For example, in Germany, there is a viable Green Party with parliamentary seats.” “Parliamentary systems also give rise to leaders who can make compromises because they have to form coalitions by necessity or they can’t run the government.” “When you have more party choices, parties can focus more on one or two issues which may appeal particularly to women, and therefore to more women candidates.” 
				We are seeing women engaged and active in a different way - it feels different. It feels like change is more possible than ever.			 
				 by  Amanda Hunter			 Similarly, when people are generally more open to progressive ideas, they will be more likely to accept women candidates, says Smethers. “New Zealand is perhaps just more progressive generally. It was one of the first countries to give women the vote and they are much more active on human rights issues. One bit of progressive thinking opens the mind to others.” Koch-Mehrin believes that systems which have seen higher numbers of women in political power are the ones which have reformed the way they work – such as the changes made in the EU Parliament to accommodate mothers of babies. But, mostly, it is a matter of building a history of more women in power to create a new “normal” which voters will start to accept without questioning. “In Finland, for the third time, we see a government that has more women ministers than men. So, it’s no longer big news in Finland.” “This is a numbers game – just increasing the numbers of women in power is hugely important.” Similarly, in the EU, the numbers of women in parliament have increased every year since the first elections in 1979 – rising to nearly 40 percent now. The fact that women have started to come out in much greater support of each other – sparked by the #MeToo campaign – is crucial, says Hunter. “After 2016, there was the women’s march in 2017 and a record number of women were elected to office in the US. This last round of presidential nominations, we had six women on the presidential slate and much more diversity as well. So, there are people growing up now who won’t remember a time that women weren’t up there on the candidacy lists. “This cycle has been so different to the run-up to 2016. Voters have been able to see women debating and supporting each other this time around. This is what will build a foundation for people to start to see voting for a woman as no big deal. “We are seeing women engaged and active in a different way – it feels different. It feels like change is more possible than ever.” If having more women in power is the key to more women becoming leaders, then, many argue, quotas are an essential tool to achieve this. The idea of using quotas is hotly contested, however. As a result, WPL does not take a formal stance either way because the members of its network disagree about the usefulness of quotas. However, Koch-Mehrin says: “My personal view is, yes, we do need quotas in order to normalise the idea of women in power.” Quotas can, in fact, be used to motivate men to become more active in promoting female candidates, she says. The constitution of the German Green Party, for example, stipulates that there must be equal numbers of men and women candidates, which means that men simply can’t run for office unless they ensure a woman is running as well. “If a party sets it up as a rule, then it becomes normal,” says Koch-Mehrin. 
				You have to intervene. Around 80 percent of countries with more than 30 percent women MPs have used intervention to achieve that. If you just wait for it to drip through, it doesn't happen.			 
				 by  Sam Smethers			 In the US, where quotas for women are unpopular, it is clear that women are hampered from achieving the top positions. The Barbara Lee Family Foundation has conducted research which shows that to be a woman president, a woman will need to have a track record of holding mayorships and governorships, Hunter says. But, until parties start actively promoting women to winnable seats, this is unlikely to happen any time soon. While the post-2016 backlash to the election of Donald Trump saw record numbers of women elected to positions of power in the US – a record-breaking 103 women were elected or re-elected to the House of Representatives – says Pahnke, female representation remains low in the US. “There has been talk about a surge in numbers, and there has been one, but it is still very low,” he says. “We have 23 percent women in the House of Representatives – that is very low. This is a major issue in the US because there is no institutional support for women candidates.” “The US is really bad for this. Even where there are quotas for women, they don’t allocate resources to make it work. There is nothing to do that in the US.” Smethers adds: “Where we improve women’s representation generally, there we get more women leaders.” “In the UK, the left-wing parties, Labour and the Liberal Democrats, are progressive in regards to women’s shortlists. The Conservative Party, however, says they want women to get there on merit. But the men are not there on merit.” As a result, only 24 percent of Conservative MPs in the UK are women, while 51 percent of Labour MPs and 66 percent of Lib Dem MPs are women. “Labour has taken 20 years to achieve this, but they have also got better at placing women into electable seats,” says Smethers. “You have to intervene. Around 80 percent of countries with more than 30 percent women MPs have used intervention to achieve that. If you just wait for it to drip through, it doesn’t happen.” Indeed, we may",,,,,,,,,

"Observers caution against inaction due to the delay, with the UN warning that time is not on the planet’s side. Critical United Nations climate negotiations, at which nations were expected to ramp up plans to combat global warming, have been pushed back a full year to November 2021. The deferment has been done in light of the coronavirus pandemic and other concerns, British politician Alok Sharma, who is also the president of the talks, announced on Twitter on Thursday. “Pleased to have agreed a new date for @COP26,” wrote Sharma, the United Kingdom’s Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. “COP26 will now take place between 1 and 12 November 2021.” While many climate observers consider the delay understandable given the circumstances, they warn that any postponement could risk further stalling time-sensitive actions needed by countries across the globe to slow global warming. The UK proposed the new dates for the Glasgow conference – which had already been suspended – in a letter to the UN climate forum, citing health concerns amid the coronavirus pandemic, and the need for more time to prepare for the 30,000-strong meeting.     Pleased to have agreed a new date for @COP26 with our Italian partners and the @UNFCCC . #COP26 will now take place between 1 and 12 November 2021. The new date will also allow the UK and Italy to harness the #G7 and #G20 presidencies in driving climate ambition. — Alok Sharma (@AlokSharma_RDG) May 28, 2020 The revised schedule was vetted and approved on Thursday night. However, possible drawbacks of the delay were laid out in a briefing note, obtained by the AFP news agency and drafted before the deliberations. They included “the potential loss of momentum” going into the forum. One of the time-sensitive issues is a 2020 deadline in the original schedule for the submission of revised, and possibly more ambitious, “nationally determined contributions” of each country’s plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Current national pledges, submitted in an annex to the 2015 Paris Agreement, would allow the planet’s surface to warm at least three degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, far above the upper limit of “well below” two degrees Celsius or 1.5 degrees Celsius if feasible, agreed to in the landmark treaty. The UN’s climate science advisory panel, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), has made it clear that time is not the planet’s side, especially if global warming is to be capped at the safer level of a 1.5-degree Celsius rise. Carbon dioxide pouring into the atmosphere must be halved by 2030, and reach “net zero” by mid-century, if that more ambitious goal is to be met, the IPCC has said. While the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic is projected to reduce global CO2 emissions this year by four to seven percent, it will have scant impact on global warming’s long-term trajectory, according to a recent study in the journal Nature Climate Change. Most observers endorsed the postponement, but cautioned against inaction. “Shifting the date of COP26 is understandable, but there can be no let-up in tackling the climate crisis,” said Andrew Steer, president and CEO of the World Resources Institute in Washington, DC, in the United States. Trillion-dollar recovery packages across Europe, North America and East Asia offer a “once-in-a-generation moment to rebuild societies to be more sustainable, equitable, resilient and healthy,” he said in a statement. Global warming continues to gather pace, other experts pointed out. “The coronavirus pandemic has not placed the climate crisis on hold, as the continuing spate of extreme weather across the world makes clear,” said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, DC.

"Observers caution against inaction due to the delay, with the UN warning that time is not on the planet’s side. Critical United Nations climate negotiations, at which nations were expected to ramp up plans to combat global warming, have been pushed back a full year to November 2021. The deferment has been done in light of the coronavirus pandemic and other concerns, British politician Alok Sharma, who is also the president of the talks, announced on Twitter on Thursday. “Pleased to have agreed a new date for @COP26,” wrote Sharma, the United Kingdom’s Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. “COP26 will now take place between 1 and 12 November 2021.” While many climate observers consider the delay understandable given the circumstances, they warn that any postponement could risk further stalling time-sensitive actions needed by countries across the globe to slow global warming. The UK proposed the new dates for the Glasgow conference – which had already been suspended – in a letter to the UN climate forum, citing health concerns amid the coronavirus pandemic, and the need for more time to prepare for the 30,000-strong meeting.     Pleased to have agreed a new date for @COP26 with our Italian partners and the @UNFCCC . #COP26 will now take place between 1 and 12 November 2021. The new date will also allow the UK and Italy to harness the #G7 and #G20 presidencies in driving climate ambition. — Alok Sharma (@AlokSharma_RDG) May 28, 2020 The revised schedule was vetted and approved on Thursday night. However, possible drawbacks of the delay were laid out in a briefing note, obtained by the AFP news agency and drafted before the deliberations. They included “the potential loss of momentum” going into the forum. One of the time-sensitive issues is a 2020 deadline in the original schedule for the submission of revised, and possibly more ambitious, “nationally determined contributions” of each country’s plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Current national pledges, submitted in an annex to the 2015 Paris Agreement, would allow the planet’s surface to warm at least three degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, far above the upper limit of “well below” two degrees Celsius or 1.5 degrees Celsius if feasible, agreed to in the landmark treaty. The UN’s climate science advisory panel, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), has made it clear that time is not the planet’s side, especially if global warming is to be capped at the safer level of a 1.5-degree Celsius rise. Carbon dioxide pouring into the atmosphere must be halved by 2030, and reach “net zero” by mid-century, if that more ambitious goal is to be met, the IPCC has said. While the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic is projected to reduce global CO2 emissions this year by four to seven percent, it will have scant impact on global warming’s long-term trajectory, according to a recent study in the journal Nature Climate Change. Most observers endorsed the postponement, but cautioned against inaction. “Shifting the date of COP26 is understandable, but there can be no let-up in tackling the climate crisis,” said Andrew Steer, president and CEO of the World Resources Institute in Washington, DC, in the United States. Trillion-dollar recovery packages across Europe, North America and East Asia offer a “once-in-a-generation moment to rebuild societies to be more sustainable, equitable, resilient and healthy,” he said in a statement. Global warming continues to gather pace, other experts pointed out. “The coronavirus pandemic has not placed the climate crisis on hold, as the continuing spate of extreme weather across the world makes clear,” said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, DC. Last week, South Asia’s first super cyclone in two decades ravaged eastern India, including Kolkata, while northern India was hit by searing heatwaves and locust swarms linked to climate change. Scientists in the US, meanwhile, warned of a more severe-than-usual Atlantic hurricane season. Other important environmental conferences have also been pushed back in response to the pandemic.

"Observers caution against inaction due to the delay, with the UN warning that time is not on the planet’s side. Critical United Nations climate negotiations, at which nations were expected to ramp up plans to combat global warming, have been pushed back a full year to November 2021. The deferment has been done in light of the coronavirus pandemic and other concerns, British politician Alok Sharma, who is also the president of the talks, announced on Twitter on Thursday. “Pleased to have agreed a new date for @COP26,” wrote Sharma, the United Kingdom’s Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. “COP26 will now take place between 1 and 12 November 2021.” While many climate observers consider the delay understandable given the circumstances, they warn that any postponement could risk further stalling time-sensitive actions needed by countries across the globe to slow global warming.

However, possible drawbacks of the delay were laid out in a briefing note, obtained by the AFP news agency and drafted before the deliberations. They included “the potential loss of momentum” going into the forum. One of the time-sensitive issues is a 2020 deadline in the original schedule for the submission of revised, and possibly more ambitious, “nationally determined contributions” of each country’s plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Current national pledges, submitted in an annex to the 2015 Paris Agreement, would allow the planet’s surface to warm at least three degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, far above the upper limit of “well below” two degrees Celsius or 1.5 degrees Celsius if feasible, agreed to in the landmark treaty. The UN’s climate science advisory panel, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), has made it clear that time is not the planet’s side, especially if global warming is to be capped at the safer level of a 1.5-degree Celsius rise. Carbon dioxide pouring into the atmosphere must be halved by 2030, and reach “net zero” by mid-century, if that more ambitious goal is to be met, the IPCC has said. While the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic is projected to reduce global CO2 emissions this year by four to seven percent, it will have scant impact on global warming’s long-term trajectory, according to a recent study in the journal Nature Climate Change. Most observers endorsed the postponement, but cautioned against inaction. “Shifting the date of COP26 is understandable, but there can be no let-up in tackling the climate crisis,” said Andrew Steer, president and CEO of the World Resources Institute in Washington, DC, in the United States. Trillion-dollar recovery packages across Europe, North America and East Asia offer a “once-in-a-generation moment to rebuild societies to be more sustainable, equitable, resilient and healthy,” he said in a statement. Global warming continues to gather pace, other experts pointed out. “The coronavirus pandemic has not placed the climate crisis on hold, as the continuing spate of extreme weather across the world makes clear,” said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, DC.

"Climate change combined with overfishing, coastal development and declining water quality destroyed ecosystems home to at least a quarter of all marine animals and plants. Global warming helped wipe out 14 percent of the world’s coral reefs between 2009 and 2018, the largest-ever survey of coral health has found, warning that more of the vibrant underwater ecosystems were likely to die if oceans warm further. Corals in South Asia and the Pacific, around the Arabian Peninsula, and off the coast of Australia, were the hardest hit, according to the report which was released on Tuesday, compiled by more than 300 scientists in the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network. The report spanned data for 40 years, 73 countries and 12,000 sites and found the total area destroyed equal to about 11,700 square kilometres (4,517 square miles). “Climate change is the biggest threat to the world’s reefs,” co-author Paul Hardisty, the chief executive of the Australian Institute of Marine Science, said in a statement. Coral reefs cover only 0.2 percent of the ocean floor, but they are home to at least a quarter of all marine animals and plants. Besides anchoring marine ecosystems, they also provide food, protection from storms and shoreline erosion and jobs for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. The study looked at 10 coral reef-bearing regions around the world and found that reef loss was mainly the result of coral bleaching, but also overfishing, unsustainable coastal development and declining water quality. “There are clearly unsettling trends toward coral loss, and we can expect these to continue as warming persists,” Hardisty said. Oceans absorb more than 90 percent of the excess heat from greenhouse gas emissions and bleaching takes place when corals, under stress from warmer water, expel the colourful algae living in their tissues and turn white. A single so-called bleaching event in 1998 caused by warming waters wiped out 8 percent of all corals. “Since 2009 we have lost more coral worldwide than all the living coral in Australia,” noted UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen. “We can reverse the losses, but we have to act now.” The UN’s climate science advisory panel, the IPCC, projects with “high confidence” that global warming of 1.5C above preindustrial levels will see between 70 and 90 percent of all corals disappear. In a 2C world, less than 1 percent of global corals would survive. Earth’s average surface temperature has already increased by 1.1C above that benchmark. The report titled: Status of Coral Reefs of the World: 2020, found reasons for cautious optimism. “Some reefs have shown a remarkable ability to bounce back, which offers some hope for the future recovery of degraded reefs,” Hardisty said. East and Southeast Asia’s so-called Coral Triangle, which contains nearly 30 percent of the world’s coral reefs, were hit less hard by the warming waters and in some cases showed recovery. This resilience could be due to species unique to the region, potentially offering strategies for boosting coral growth elsewhere, the authors said.

Coral reefs cover only 0.2 percent of the ocean floor, but they are home to at least a quarter of all marine animals and plants. Besides anchoring marine ecosystems, they also provide food, protection from storms and shoreline erosion and jobs for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. The study looked at 10 coral reef-bearing regions around the world and found that reef loss was mainly the result of coral bleaching, but also overfishing, unsustainable coastal development and declining water quality. “There are clearly unsettling trends toward coral loss, and we can expect these to continue as warming persists,” Hardisty said. Oceans absorb more than 90 percent of the excess heat from greenhouse gas emissions and bleaching takes place when corals, under stress from warmer water, expel the colourful algae living in their tissues and turn white. A single so-called bleaching event in 1998 caused by warming waters wiped out 8 percent of all corals. “Since 2009 we have lost more coral worldwide than all the living coral in Australia,” noted UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen. “We can reverse the losses, but we have to act now.” The UN’s climate science advisory panel, the IPCC, projects with “high confidence” that global warming of 1.5C above preindustrial levels will see between 70 and 90 percent of all corals disappear. In a 2C world, less than 1 percent of global corals would survive. Earth’s average surface temperature has already increased by 1.1C above that benchmark. The report titled: Status of Coral Reefs of the World: 2020, found reasons for cautious optimism. “Some reefs have shown a remarkable ability to bounce back, which offers some hope for the future recovery of degraded reefs,” Hardisty said. East and Southeast Asia’s so-called Coral Triangle, which contains nearly 30 percent of the world’s coral reefs, were hit less hard by the warming waters and in some cases showed recovery. This resilience could be due to species unique to the region, potentially offering strategies for boosting coral growth elsewhere, the authors said.

"In a virtual policy conference, 54 percent of the party’s delegates vote against adding ‘climate change is real’ to policy book. Members of Canada’s main opposition Conservative Party have rejected a proposed change to their policy book that would recognise that “climate change is real”, hours after a plea from the party leader that the Conservatives would have to embrace change. In a virtual policy conference, 54 percent of delegates on Saturday voted against a proposal to update the policy book by adding that “climate change is real” and that the party is “willing to act” on it, according to results posted online. The resolution also sought to place more responsibility on “highly polluting” Canadian companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support innovation in green technologies. The vote came just a day after party leader Erin O’Toole told fellow Conservatives they must “change” if they are to expand the party’s base. He also said the members can no longer “ignore the reality of climate change” if they hope to oust the minority government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in possible snap elections in the coming months. “The debate is over, climate change is real,” O’Toole insisted in further remarks during a session on Saturday. “We will have a serious and comprehensive plan on climate change to reduce emissions. “It’s important to me as a father of young children. As a member of parliament, climate change, and fighting it, is important to the Conservative Party of Canada. Younger voters expect that from us.” But the Conservative chief also reiterated his opposition to a carbon tax the Trudeau government imposed in 2019 in a move to curb pollution. O’Toole, in the leadership position since August, offered no details of what he said would be a bold new plan to replace that tax, which is strongly opposed in western Conservative strongholds. Conservative leaders have indicated that they have no intention at the moment to try to push out the Trudeau government – given the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic – but pressure to call early elections has recently grown. The Conservatives currently control 120 of the 338 seats in the House of Commons with the Liberals holding 154.

"As families migrate after climate-related disasters, UNICEF says 1.7 million of the country’s children are now labourers. Twelve-year-old Alamin’s house rested on the bank of the Ilsha River in southern Bangladesh until last year, when the surging river eroded it and the family’s farmland away, forcing them to flee to a slum in Keraniganj, close to the capital Dhaka. Now Alamin – whose father died of cancer a couple of years ago – works on a shipbreaking crew and his mother cooks for the workers. Together they earn just enough to feed and house themselves and Alamin’s two younger siblings, now 3 and 5. “Once we were solvent. My husband earned from our cultivable land and my son was reading in a local primary school,” said his mother, Amina Begum. But after losing their property to the river and their savings to failed cancer treatments, work is all Alamin can now expect, she lamented. As more extreme weather drives worsening flooding, erosion and storms in low-lying Bangladesh, thousands of families like hers are moving to the slums of Dhaka. For many of their children – who are battling the impacts of climate change alongside their parents – the move means the end of education and the start of a lifetime of hard labour . In an August report, UNICEF, the UN children’s agency, said children in the South Asian nations of Bangladesh, Afghanistan and India now face “extremely high” risks from climate change impacts. Globally, about a billion children in 33 countries face that level of threat, it added. “For the first time, we have clear evidence of the impact of climate change on millions of children in South Asia,” said George Laryea-Adjei, UNICEF’s regional director for South Asia, in the report. Droughts, floods and river erosion across the region have left millions of children homeless, hungry, lacking healthcare and safe water and, in many cases, out of school, UNICEF officials said. “Climate change has created an alarming crisis for South Asian children,” Laryea-Adjei noted. In Bangladesh, a fertile delta nation of close to 700 rivers, a difficult combination of more flood-driven erosion and little land for resettlement is driving many once-rural families into urban slums. Children, who make up about 40 percent of the population of the country of more than 160 million, are paying a particularly high price in the move, researchers say. Most Bangladeshi children not attending primary school live in urban slums, or in hard-to-reach or disaster-prone areas, according to UNICEF. About 1.7 million children in the country are labourers, one in four of them 11 years old or younger, the agency’s research shows. Girls, who often work as domestic labourers, rarely even show up in the statistics, UNICEF noted. In slums around Dhaka, children are evident, working in tanneries, shipyards, tailor shops, or automobile repair workshops. Others labour at vegetable markets or carry luggage in bus, train and boat terminals. Many say they once lived in the countryside before being forced to the city. A sweating Alauddin, 10, has worked at a vegetable market in Dhaka for a few months now, doing things like cleaning and hauling potatoes in metal bowls he can barely lift. He said he used to attend Debraipatch Primary School, near the northeast city of Jamalpur, until a powerful flood last year wrecked the school and his family’s home and land. They moved to a Dhaka slum, where his father now pulls a rickshaw and his mother works part-time as a cleaner at a private school. Alauddin’s work contributes 100 taka ($1.15) a day to the family finances, money the family can’t do without, his father said. “My children will never go back to school,” he admitted. “We are struggling with rent and our daily livelihood. How would we bear [my son’s] educational expenses?” Mohibul Hasan Chowdhury, Bangladesh’s deputy state minister of education, said in a telephone interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation that floods last year inundated more than 500 educational institutions in 10 districts across the country. While a few were entirely washed away, most have since dried out – but only a few have been repaired sufficiently to be available for classes, he said. The new flood-related closures come on the heels of long pandemic-related shutdowns, and mean even children who do not have to work are still out of classrooms in many places. Bangladesh’s Annual Primary School Census for 2021 showed 10.24 million students attending 65,000 government primary schools – but noted the drop-out rate in 2021 was more than 17 percent, with more than 2 million children leaving school. Global warming impacts were a top driver of that flight from classrooms, educational officials said. Alamgir Mohammad Mansurul Alam, director-general of the Directorate of Primary Education, called the drop-out rate “alarming” and noted “one of the big reasons is climate change”. “Last year we observed that more than 500 schools were damaged by flooding. The students could not go to school for a long time,” he said in an interview. What became evident, he said, is that “a large number of them never come back to school and are involved in different work to support their family.” More than 14,000 private primary schools in Bangladesh were also at least temporarily shuttered by the COVID-19 pandemic, said Iqbal Bahar Chowdhury, chairman of the country’s private primary school association. Altogether, 37 million children in Bangladesh have seen their education disrupted by school closures since the start of the pandemic in 2020, according to an October joint report by UNICEF and UNESCO. Rupa, 9, is among the children now working instead of being in school. After her family’s home in Khulna Shyamnagar was destroyed by a cyclone last year, her family came to join an aunt living in a slum near Dhaka. Rupa’s mother eventually abandoned her blind husband, who could not work, leaving her daughter behind with him. The girl now earns 100 taka ($1.15) a day helping unload watermelons at the wharf. “I realise it’s really hard for a little girl to work with adult workers but I’m helpless. I also have a year-old baby and family to maintain,” said her aunt, who works as a cook. Syeda Munira Sultana, national project coordinator for the International Labour Organization in Bangladesh, said she has met many girls like Rupa, forced into work by extreme weather or other climate change impacts. “I was surprised to see many girls younger than 10 years old working in a factory near Keraniganj, where women’s dresses are produced,” she said. “I talked to them and they said most of them came from climate-vulnerable areas like Barisal, Khulna and Satkhira – and all of them are dropouts from school,” she added. Children forced to work can face both physical and mental harm as well as losing their chance at an education, which can restrict their future opportunities and lead to inter-generational cycles of poverty and child labour, said Tuomo Poutiainen, director of the ILO’s Bangladesh office. “Children are paying a high price for climate change,” added Sheldon Yett, UNICEF’s representative in Bangladesh.

Climate change:  Refers to the long-term alteration in the Earth's climate patterns, particularly the rise in global temperatures, caused by human activities such as the use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrialization. 
2. Flooding:  The inundation of land by water, usually due to heavy rainfall, that causes damage to property, infrastructure and people. In the case of Bangladesh, flooding is worsening due to climate change, which is causing sea-levels to rise, monsoons to grow more intense and river deltas to become more vulnerable to flooding. 
3. Migration:  The movement of people from one place to another, mainly for better opportunities or to avoid harmful conditions. The increasing frequency and intensity of climate-related disasters, such as floods and cyclones, are forcing people in Bangladesh to flee their homes and migrate to other locations, particularly to urban centers like Dhaka. 
4. Hard labor:  Refers to work that is physically demanding, low-paying, and often harmful to health or safety. Children who migrate with their families following climate-related disasters often end up in the informal sector, working in jobs that pay low wages and require long hours of hard labor. This kind of work is often hazardous, and can lead to chronic health problems and economic insecurity.","University of Southern Mindanao, Narra, Bangladesh, Buluan, Maguindanao, Bangsamoro, 9616, Philippines",6.7144781,124.7862389

Altogether, 37 million children in Bangladesh have seen their education disrupted by school closures since the start of the pandemic in 2020, according to an October joint report by UNICEF and UNESCO. Rupa, 9, is among the children now working instead of being in school. After her family’s home in Khulna Shyamnagar was destroyed by a cyclone last year, her family came to join an aunt living in a slum near Dhaka. Rupa’s mother eventually abandoned her blind husband, who could not work, leaving her daughter behind with him. The girl now earns 100 taka ($1.15) a day helping unload watermelons at the wharf. “I realise it’s really hard for a little girl to work with adult workers but I’m helpless. I also have a year-old baby and family to maintain,” said her aunt, who works as a cook. Syeda Munira Sultana, national project coordinator for the International Labour Organization in Bangladesh, said she has met many girls like Rupa, forced into work by extreme weather or other climate change impacts. “I was surprised to see many girls younger than 10 years old working in a factory near Keraniganj, where women’s dresses are produced,” she said. “I talked to them and they said most of them came from climate-vulnerable areas like Barisal, Khulna and Satkhira – and all of them are dropouts from school,” she added. Children forced to work can face both physical and mental harm as well as losing their chance at an education, which can restrict their future opportunities and lead to inter-generational cycles of poverty and child labour, said Tuomo Poutiainen, director of the ILO’s Bangladesh office. “Children are paying a high price for climate change,” added Sheldon Yett, UNICEF’s representative in Bangladesh.

"As families migrate after climate-related disasters, UNICEF says 1.7 million of the country’s children are now labourers. Twelve-year-old Alamin’s house rested on the bank of the Ilsha River in southern Bangladesh until last year, when the surging river eroded it and the family’s farmland away, forcing them to flee to a slum in Keraniganj, close to the capital Dhaka. Now Alamin – whose father died of cancer a couple of years ago – works on a shipbreaking crew and his mother cooks for the workers. Together they earn just enough to feed and house themselves and Alamin’s two younger siblings, now 3 and 5. “Once we were solvent. My husband earned from our cultivable land and my son was reading in a local primary school,” said his mother, Amina Begum. But after losing their property to the river and their savings to failed cancer treatments, work is all Alamin can now expect, she lamented. As more extreme weather drives worsening flooding, erosion and storms in low-lying Bangladesh, thousands of families like hers are moving to the slums of Dhaka. For many of their children – who are battling the impacts of climate change alongside their parents – the move means the end of education and the start of a lifetime of hard labour . In an August report, UNICEF, the UN children’s agency, said children in the South Asian nations of Bangladesh, Afghanistan and India now face “extremely high” risks from climate change impacts. Globally, about a billion children in 33 countries face that level of threat, it added. “For the first time, we have clear evidence of the impact of climate change on millions of children in South Asia,” said George Laryea-Adjei, UNICEF’s regional director for South Asia, in the report. Droughts, floods and river erosion across the region have left millions of children homeless, hungry, lacking healthcare and safe water and, in many cases, out of school, UNICEF officials said. “Climate change has created an alarming crisis for South Asian children,” Laryea-Adjei noted. In Bangladesh, a fertile delta nation of close to 700 rivers, a difficult combination of more flood-driven erosion and little land for resettlement is driving many once-rural families into urban slums. Children, who make up about 40 percent of the population of the country of more than 160 million, are paying a particularly high price in the move, researchers say. Most Bangladeshi children not attending primary school live in urban slums, or in hard-to-reach or disaster-prone areas, according to UNICEF. About 1.7 million children in the country are labourers, one in four of them 11 years old or younger, the agency’s research shows. Girls, who often work as domestic labourers, rarely even show up in the statistics, UNICEF noted. In slums around Dhaka, children are evident, working in tanneries, shipyards, tailor shops, or automobile repair workshops. Others labour at vegetable markets or carry luggage in bus, train and boat terminals. Many say they once lived in the countryside before being forced to the city. A sweating Alauddin, 10, has worked at a vegetable market in Dhaka for a few months now, doing things like cleaning and hauling potatoes in metal bowls he can barely lift. He said he used to attend Debraipatch Primary School, near the northeast city of Jamalpur, until a powerful flood last year wrecked the school and his family’s home and land. They moved to a Dhaka slum, where his father now pulls a rickshaw and his mother works part-time as a cleaner at a private school. Alauddin’s work contributes 100 taka ($1.15) a day to the family finances, money the family can’t do without, his father said. “My children will never go back to school,” he admitted. “We are struggling with rent and our daily livelihood. How would we bear [my son’s] educational expenses?” Mohibul Hasan Chowdhury, Bangladesh’s deputy state minister of education, said in a telephone interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation that floods last year inundated more than 500 educational institutions in 10 districts across the country. While a few were entirely washed away, most have since dried out – but only a few have been repaired sufficiently to be available for classes, he said. The new flood-related closures come on the heels of long pandemic-related shutdowns, and mean even children who do not have to work are still out of classrooms in many places. Bangladesh’s Annual Primary School Census for 2021 showed 10.24 million students attending 65,000 government primary schools – but noted the drop-out rate in 2021 was more than 17 percent, with more than 2 million children leaving school. Global warming impacts were a top driver of that flight from classrooms, educational officials said. Alamgir Mohammad Mansurul Alam, director-general of the Directorate of Primary Education, called the drop-out rate “alarming” and noted “one of the big reasons is climate change”. “Last year we observed that more than 500 schools were damaged by flooding. The students could not go to school for a long time,” he said in an interview. What became evident, he said, is that “a large number of them never come back to school and are involved in different work to support their family.” More than 14,000 private primary schools in Bangladesh were also at least temporarily shuttered by the COVID-19 pandemic, said Iqbal Bahar Chowdhury, chairman of the country’s private primary school association.

They moved to a Dhaka slum, where his father now pulls a rickshaw and his mother works part-time as a cleaner at a private school. Alauddin’s work contributes 100 taka ($1.15) a day to the family finances, money the family can’t do without, his father said. “My children will never go back to school,” he admitted. “We are struggling with rent and our daily livelihood. How would we bear [my son’s] educational expenses?” Mohibul Hasan Chowdhury, Bangladesh’s deputy state minister of education, said in a telephone interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation that floods last year inundated more than 500 educational institutions in 10 districts across the country. While a few were entirely washed away, most have since dried out – but only a few have been repaired sufficiently to be available for classes, he said. The new flood-related closures come on the heels of long pandemic-related shutdowns, and mean even children who do not have to work are still out of classrooms in many places. Bangladesh’s Annual Primary School Census for 2021 showed 10.24 million students attending 65,000 government primary schools – but noted the drop-out rate in 2021 was more than 17 percent, with more than 2 million children leaving school. Global warming impacts were a top driver of that flight from classrooms, educational officials said. Alamgir Mohammad Mansurul Alam, director-general of the Directorate of Primary Education, called the drop-out rate “alarming” and noted “one of the big reasons is climate change”. “Last year we observed that more than 500 schools were damaged by flooding. The students could not go to school for a long time,” he said in an interview. What became evident, he said, is that “a large number of them never come back to school and are involved in different work to support their family.” More than 14,000 private primary schools in Bangladesh were also at least temporarily shuttered by the COVID-19 pandemic, said Iqbal Bahar Chowdhury, chairman of the country’s private primary school association. Altogether, 37 million children in Bangladesh have seen their education disrupted by school closures since the start of the pandemic in 2020, according to an October joint report by UNICEF and UNESCO. Rupa, 9, is among the children now working instead of being in school. After her family’s home in Khulna Shyamnagar was destroyed by a cyclone last year, her family came to join an aunt living in a slum near Dhaka. Rupa’s mother eventually abandoned her blind husband, who could not work, leaving her daughter behind with him. The girl now earns 100 taka ($1.15) a day helping unload watermelons at the wharf. “I realise it’s really hard for a little girl to work with adult workers but I’m helpless. I also have a year-old baby and family to maintain,” said her aunt, who works as a cook. Syeda Munira Sultana, national project coordinator for the International Labour Organization in Bangladesh, said she has met many girls like Rupa, forced into work by extreme weather or other climate change impacts. “I was surprised to see many girls younger than 10 years old working in a factory near Keraniganj, where women’s dresses are produced,” she said. “I talked to them and they said most of them came from climate-vulnerable areas like Barisal, Khulna and Satkhira – and all of them are dropouts from school,” she added. Children forced to work can face both physical and mental harm as well as losing their chance at an education, which can restrict their future opportunities and lead to inter-generational cycles of poverty and child labour, said Tuomo Poutiainen, director of the ILO’s Bangladesh office. “Children are paying a high price for climate change,” added Sheldon Yett, UNICEF’s representative in Bangladesh.

"As families migrate after climate-related disasters, UNICEF says 1.7 million of the country’s children are now labourers. Twelve-year-old Alamin’s house rested on the bank of the Ilsha River in southern Bangladesh until last year, when the surging river eroded it and the family’s farmland away, forcing them to flee to a slum in Keraniganj, close to the capital Dhaka. Now Alamin – whose father died of cancer a couple of years ago – works on a shipbreaking crew and his mother cooks for the workers. Together they earn just enough to feed and house themselves and Alamin’s two younger siblings, now 3 and 5. “Once we were solvent. My husband earned from our cultivable land and my son was reading in a local primary school,” said his mother, Amina Begum. But after losing their property to the river and their savings to failed cancer treatments, work is all Alamin can now expect, she lamented. As more extreme weather drives worsening flooding, erosion and storms in low-lying Bangladesh, thousands of families like hers are moving to the slums of Dhaka. For many of their children – who are battling the impacts of climate change alongside their parents – the move means the end of education and the start of a lifetime of hard labour . In an August report, UNICEF, the UN children’s agency, said children in the South Asian nations of Bangladesh, Afghanistan and India now face “extremely high” risks from climate change impacts. Globally, about a billion children in 33 countries face that level of threat, it added. “For the first time, we have clear evidence of the impact of climate change on millions of children in South Asia,” said George Laryea-Adjei, UNICEF’s regional director for South Asia, in the report. Droughts, floods and river erosion across the region have left millions of children homeless, hungry, lacking healthcare and safe water and, in many cases, out of school, UNICEF officials said. “Climate change has created an alarming crisis for South Asian children,” Laryea-Adjei noted. In Bangladesh, a fertile delta nation of close to 700 rivers, a difficult combination of more flood-driven erosion and little land for resettlement is driving many once-rural families into urban slums. Children, who make up about 40 percent of the population of the country of more than 160 million, are paying a particularly high price in the move, researchers say. Most Bangladeshi children not attending primary school live in urban slums, or in hard-to-reach or disaster-prone areas, according to UNICEF. About 1.7 million children in the country are labourers, one in four of them 11 years old or younger, the agency’s research shows. Girls, who often work as domestic labourers, rarely even show up in the statistics, UNICEF noted. In slums around Dhaka, children are evident, working in tanneries, shipyards, tailor shops, or automobile repair workshops. Others labour at vegetable markets or carry luggage in bus, train and boat terminals. Many say they once lived in the countryside before being forced to the city.

Droughts, floods and river erosion across the region have left millions of children homeless, hungry, lacking healthcare and safe water and, in many cases, out of school, UNICEF officials said. “Climate change has created an alarming crisis for South Asian children,” Laryea-Adjei noted. In Bangladesh, a fertile delta nation of close to 700 rivers, a difficult combination of more flood-driven erosion and little land for resettlement is driving many once-rural families into urban slums. Children, who make up about 40 percent of the population of the country of more than 160 million, are paying a particularly high price in the move, researchers say. Most Bangladeshi children not attending primary school live in urban slums, or in hard-to-reach or disaster-prone areas, according to UNICEF. About 1.7 million children in the country are labourers, one in four of them 11 years old or younger, the agency’s research shows. Girls, who often work as domestic labourers, rarely even show up in the statistics, UNICEF noted. In slums around Dhaka, children are evident, working in tanneries, shipyards, tailor shops, or automobile repair workshops. Others labour at vegetable markets or carry luggage in bus, train and boat terminals. Many say they once lived in the countryside before being forced to the city. A sweating Alauddin, 10, has worked at a vegetable market in Dhaka for a few months now, doing things like cleaning and hauling potatoes in metal bowls he can barely lift. He said he used to attend Debraipatch Primary School, near the northeast city of Jamalpur, until a powerful flood last year wrecked the school and his family’s home and land. They moved to a Dhaka slum, where his father now pulls a rickshaw and his mother works part-time as a cleaner at a private school. Alauddin’s work contributes 100 taka ($1.15) a day to the family finances, money the family can’t do without, his father said. “My children will never go back to school,” he admitted. “We are struggling with rent and our daily livelihood. How would we bear [my son’s] educational expenses?” Mohibul Hasan Chowdhury, Bangladesh’s deputy state minister of education, said in a telephone interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation that floods last year inundated more than 500 educational institutions in 10 districts across the country. While a few were entirely washed away, most have since dried out – but only a few have been repaired sufficiently to be available for classes, he said. The new flood-related closures come on the heels of long pandemic-related shutdowns, and mean even children who do not have to work are still out of classrooms in many places. Bangladesh’s Annual Primary School Census for 2021 showed 10.24 million students attending 65,000 government primary schools – but noted the drop-out rate in 2021 was more than 17 percent, with more than 2 million children leaving school. Global warming impacts were a top driver of that flight from classrooms, educational officials said. Alamgir Mohammad Mansurul Alam, director-general of the Directorate of Primary Education, called the drop-out rate “alarming” and noted “one of the big reasons is climate change”. “Last year we observed that more than 500 schools were damaged by flooding. The students could not go to school for a long time,” he said in an interview. What became evident, he said, is that “a large number of them never come back to school and are involved in different work to support their family.” More than 14,000 private primary schools in Bangladesh were also at least temporarily shuttered by the COVID-19 pandemic, said Iqbal Bahar Chowdhury, chairman of the country’s private primary school association. Altogether, 37 million children in Bangladesh have seen their education disrupted by school closures since the start of the pandemic in 2020, according to an October joint report by UNICEF and UNESCO. Rupa, 9, is among the children now working instead of being in school. After her family’s home in Khulna Shyamnagar was destroyed by a cyclone last year, her family came to join an aunt living in a slum near Dhaka. Rupa’s mother eventually abandoned her blind husband, who could not work, leaving her daughter behind with him. The girl now earns 100 taka ($1.15) a day helping unload watermelons at the wharf. “I realise it’s really hard for a little girl to work with adult workers but I’m helpless. I also have a year-old baby and family to maintain,” said her aunt, who works as a cook. Syeda Munira Sultana, national project coordinator for the International Labour Organization in Bangladesh, said she has met many girls like Rupa, forced into work by extreme weather or other climate change impacts. “I was surprised to see many girls younger than 10 years old working in a factory near Keraniganj, where women’s dresses are produced,” she said. “I talked to them and they said most of them came from climate-vulnerable areas like Barisal, Khulna and Satkhira – and all of them are dropouts from school,” she added. Children forced to work can face both physical and mental harm as well as losing their chance at an education, which can restrict their future opportunities and lead to inter-generational cycles of poverty and child labour, said Tuomo Poutiainen, director of the ILO’s Bangladesh office. “Children are paying a high price for climate change,” added Sheldon Yett, UNICEF’s representative in Bangladesh.

"As families migrate after climate-related disasters, UNICEF says 1.7 million of the country’s children are now labourers. Twelve-year-old Alamin’s house rested on the bank of the Ilsha River in southern Bangladesh until last year, when the surging river eroded it and the family’s farmland away, forcing them to flee to a slum in Keraniganj, close to the capital Dhaka. Now Alamin – whose father died of cancer a couple of years ago – works on a shipbreaking crew and his mother cooks for the workers. Together they earn just enough to feed and house themselves and Alamin’s two younger siblings, now 3 and 5. “Once we were solvent. My husband earned from our cultivable land and my son was reading in a local primary school,” said his mother, Amina Begum. But after losing their property to the river and their savings to failed cancer treatments, work is all Alamin can now expect, she lamented. As more extreme weather drives worsening flooding, erosion and storms in low-lying Bangladesh, thousands of families like hers are moving to the slums of Dhaka.

This kind of work is often hazardous, and can lead to chronic health problems and economic insecurity.","সাতক্ষীরা, সাতক্ষীরা সদর উপজেলা, সাতক্ষীরা জেলা, খুলনা বিভাগ, 9400, বাংলাদেশ",22.7166509,89.0749857

 Ever-more frequent  extreme weather events  have in recent years devastated rural regions in developing countries, with millions of people having to start from scratch after losing everything in storms, droughts and floods. But while these short, sharp crises have dealt a hammer blow to agrarian and pastoral communities, scientists also warn that ‘slow onset’ changes to the climate are forcing growing numbers of people to migrate in order to earn a living and support their families. Global temperatures could increase more in the next 50 years than in the previous 6,000, according to a  study by scientists  published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in May 2020. It says extreme heat only common to regions such as the Sahara today could eventually blanket 19% of the world’s land by 2070, meaning “1 to 3 billion people are projected to be left outside the climate conditions that have served humanity well”. And with the climate crisis already unfolding, millions of people across the world are already on the move. The UN’s International Organization for Migration estimates that environmental factors may factor into the migration of between  25 million and 1 billion people  by 2050. While researchers say harsh climatic conditions are rarely a lone factor behind individuals’ decision to migrate in search of a stable livelihood, environmental challenges are exacerbating existing hardships, especially in rural regions. People across Central America, Africa’s Sahel region and South Asia are among those moving to urban centres in search of work. But it’s not uncommon that migrants arriving in cities subsequently face further deprivation, exploitation, and local intolerance . Many migrants facing difficulties in cities feel they have little option but to cross international borders, as a last resort. Yet increasingly tight border policies by developed countries in recent years already suggests that people migrating for their very survival may find little help from governments of the world’s richest nations. In this episode of The Stream, we’ll ask what is needed to humanely address the challenges of increased migration as global heating affects vulnerable communities.

"As global temperatures rise, activists are amping up the vocabulary used to describe the crisis in media and politics. Four European countries saw soaring temperatures smash heat records this week, putting July on track to be the hottest month ever recorded. A mass of steamy air from the Sahara Desert gave Western capitals mercury readings more common in Middle Eastern cities. Scientists say greenhouse gas emissions are causing the much warmer weather, and activists are changing the jargon around climate change to keep pace with the thermometer. Because the globe is getting much hotter . Britain, France, Germany and the Netherlands all experienced record-beating temperatures this week, with Paris seeing the highest heat  – 42.6C (108.7 Fahrenheit) – since records began. Climate scientists say that such heatwaves are only becoming more frequent and are a direct result of rising temperatures from emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases. Experts are saying that, of the 1,675 months since January 1880 – when temperature records began – July 2019 will probably be the absolute hottest globally. By most reasonable standards, recent temperature patterns suggest that the Earth is now experiencing “heating” well beyond mere global “warming”. So, many climate advocates – and their allies in media outlets, ivory towers and legislative bodies – prefer the stronger term. Activists are increasingly calling for the words to shift from climate “change” to a “crisis” or “emergency”. Environmental groups argue that these terms more accurately reflect not just record-breaking temperatures, but also recent droughts, floods, storms and other weather-related disasters – in addition to the agricultural collapse, mass migration and violent conflict that results from climate disruption. The United Nations certainly recognises this as a “ crisis “, as 860 local governments in 18 countries have declared it an “ emergency “. Due to the overwhelming evidence of a worsening climate and increasingly common “natural” disasters, most scientists think that there is a definitive link between pollution by humans and rising temperatures. But for those who reject the scientific reality, activists feel “sceptic” is too weak. They prefer to use the more pointed term “denier”. In the United States – the world’s biggest economy and the largest contributor to historical emissions that have caused global heating – the Green New Deal framework is increasingly considered a viable way to reduce fossil fuel consumption, transition to alternative energy, and revive depressed communities that are disproportionately impacted by the climate crisis. The concept is an ecological version of the New Deal set of policies that created the US social safety net in the 1930s. While the necessary technology can be developed, it remains to be seen whether the political will exists to undertake such a massive programme. Another framework that might help ordinary citizens and political leaders take on the monumental climate task refers to the upcoming economic transformation as a “mobilisation”. The historical reference is to the World War II period when US government policy – as well as efforts in many other countries – was focused singularly on channeling all economic resources into the war effort.  Some pessimists believe only a truly catastrophic event – far worse than any previous hurricane or refugee crisis – will adequately motivate people, fund the huge challenge, and begin to solve the climate problem. Yet many activists argue that the best way to mitigate the climate emergency is through political mobilisation akin to when a society devotes its capacities to waging a war. Fifty years after humans first landed on the moon, a number of US political leaders – including current candidates for president – have cited the accomplishment as the best framing for a successful launch of climate endeavors. Former New York City Mayor and billionaire philanthropist Michael Bloomberg, who recently announced a $500m Beyond Carbon initiative, said recently that “It may be a moon shot – but it’s the only shot we’ve got”.

"Joe Biden will be the fourth US president that Merkel – who has led Germany since 2005 – has dealt with as chancellor. The US and Germany must stand “side by side” in handling the coronavirus pandemic, fighting global warming and “terrorism”, and in working for “an open global economy and free trade”, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Monday. President-elect Joe Biden brings decades of experience in domestic and foreign policy to the job, and “he knows Germany and Europe well”, Merkel said in her first in-person comments on the election outcome. The chancellor had congratulated Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris in writing on Saturday. “The United States of America and Germany as part of the European Union must stand together to deal with the great challenges of our time,” Merkel said in a statement to reporters in Berlin. “Side by side in the difficult test of the corona pandemic, side by side in the fight against global warming and its global consequences, (and) in the fight against terrorism, side by side for an open world economy and free trade, because those are the foundations of our prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic.” Biden will be the fourth US president that Merkel – who has led Germany since 2005 – has dealt with as chancellor. Relations with current President Donald Trump have often been frosty; Merkel stands for a multilateral approach to global affairs and is firmly behind efforts to combat climate change. The German leader, whose country has faced US pressure – even before the Trump administration came into office – to increase its defence spending, said: “We Germans and Europeans know that we must take on more responsibility of our own in this partnership in the 21st century.” “America is and remains our most important ally but it expects of us – and rightly – greater efforts of our own to take care of our security and to stand up for our convictions in the world,” Merkel added. “And we Europeans have long since set out along this road.” ","Merkel: US, Germany must stand together on climate change",merkel-us-germany-must-stand-together-on-climate-change,47:44.0,32:45.1,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken in favor of greater partnership between the US and Germany under President-elect Joe Biden, saying the two nations must work together on issues like the pandemic, climate change, terrorism, and free trade.

The chancellor congratulated Biden on his win over the weekend, and said the US and Germany must both take more responsibility for their own security in the 21st century.","1) Climate change: the long-term alteration of global weather patterns, particularly an increase in global temperatures, caused primarily by human activity that releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

"This is the first of several climate-related lawsuits pending against major oil companies slated to go to trial. Exxon Mobil Corp on Tuesday was due to go on trial in the United States , facing a lawsuit by New York State’s attorney general accusing the energy giant of misleading investors about the risks of climate change regulations to its business. The trial, which is expected to begin before Justice Barry Ostrager in Manhattan Supreme Court and which could last up to three weeks, may feature testimony from Rex Tillerson, who was Exxon’s chief executive before serving as US Secretary of State under President Donald Trump. It is the first of several lawsuits currently pending against major oil companies related to climate change to go to trial. “The New York Attorney General’s allegations are false,” Exxon said in a statement. “We tell investors through regular disclosures how the company accounts for risks associated with climate change. We are confident in the facts and look forward to seeing our company exonerated in court.” The New York attorney general’s office had no immediate comment on Monday. The attorney general sued Exxon in October 2018 under the Martin Act, a New York State law that had been used primarily to go after financial fraud. The lawsuit claimed Exxon falsely told investors it had properly evaluated the impact of future climate regulations on its business using a “proxy cost” of up to $80 per tonne of carbon emissions. However, these proxy figures frequently were not used in its internal planning or cost assumptions, according to the lawsuit. The attorney general also accused the company of failing to account properly for the costs of potential regulation in determining the value of its oil and gas reserves. The state of Massachusetts is separately investigating whether Exxon concealed its knowledge of the role that fossil fuels play in climate change. Both Massachusetts and New York states began investigating Exxon after news outlets reported in 2015 that the company’s own scientists had determined that fossil fuel combustion must be reduced to mitigate the impact of climate change. Those reports, by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times, were based on documents from the 1970s and 1980s. Exxon said the documents were not inconsistent with its public positions.

"This is the first of several climate-related lawsuits pending against major oil companies slated to go to trial. Exxon Mobil Corp on Tuesday was due to go on trial in the United States , facing a lawsuit by New York State’s attorney general accusing the energy giant of misleading investors about the risks of climate change regulations to its business. The trial, which is expected to begin before Justice Barry Ostrager in Manhattan Supreme Court and which could last up to three weeks, may feature testimony from Rex Tillerson, who was Exxon’s chief executive before serving as US Secretary of State under President Donald Trump. It is the first of several lawsuits currently pending against major oil companies related to climate change to go to trial. “The New York Attorney General’s allegations are false,” Exxon said in a statement. “We tell investors through regular disclosures how the company accounts for risks associated with climate change. We are confident in the facts and look forward to seeing our company exonerated in court.” The New York attorney general’s office had no immediate comment on Monday. The attorney general sued Exxon in October 2018 under the Martin Act, a New York State law that had been used primarily to go after financial fraud. The lawsuit claimed Exxon falsely told investors it had properly evaluated the impact of future climate regulations on its business using a “proxy cost” of up to $80 per tonne of carbon emissions. However, these proxy figures frequently were not used in its internal planning or cost assumptions, according to the lawsuit. The attorney general also accused the company of failing to account properly for the costs of potential regulation in determining the value of its oil and gas reserves.

"UK plans to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 while boosting jobs and repairing economic damage due to COVID-19. The United Kingdom says it plans to invest one billion pounds ($1.39bn) to cut emissions from industry, schools and hospitals as part of wider “green revolution” designed to create thousands of jobs and meet climate targets. The UK has a target to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and is also seeking to boost jobs and repair economic damage caused by the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. “Today’s plans will make a considerable dent in the amount of carbon emissions emitting from our economy and put us on the path to eliminate our contribution to climate change by 2050,” Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said in a statement on Wednesday. The measures will create and support up to 80,000 jobs over the next 30 years and help the country cut emissions from industry by two-thirds in 15 years, the statement said. Cutting emissions from industry is one of the toughest areas in the fight against climate change. Furnaces reaching 1,500 degrees Celsius (2,700 Fahrenheit) are needed to forge steel or produce cement and renewable energy alone can not produce those sorts of temperatures. The government’s new strategy sets an expectation for industry to switch 20 terawatt-hours of its energy from fossil fuels to low carbon sources by 2030. That is equivalent to 17 percent of all renewable energy generated by the UK in 2019. Ultra-high temperatures have conventionally been produced by burning coal or gas. That now has to change and the government is betting on the development of hydrogen to help replace fossil fuels, especially in energy-intensive industries. Some 932 million pounds ($1.3bn) will be directed to 429 projects across England to help reduce emissions from public buildings such as schools, hospitals and council buildings through low-carbon schemes including energy-efficient insulation, low-carbon heating systems, installing solar panels and efficient lighting. A further 171 million pounds ($238m) will be allocated to nine projects in Scotland, South Wales and North West, Humber and Teesside in England to help decarbonise industry. These include projects to capture, store and use carbon emissions and projects to use cleaner fuels such as hydrogen. “The Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy will send a clear signal to the market by setting out how the government expects decarbonisation to happen, while improving investor confidence,” Kwarteng said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson last year announced a “green revolution” which he said would mobilise a total of 12 billion pounds ($16.7bn) of government money and create 250,000 highly skilled green jobs by 2030. Meanwhile, policymakers from around the world are calling for more ambition ahead of November’s crucial United Nations climate talks in the UK. Johnson’s government on Tuesday committed to making climate change its top priority for foreign policy as the UK seeks to carve out a new role in the world after leaving the European Union. There is pressure on the UK to lead by example, an aspiration that has been called into question over its plans to build a new deep coal mine in northern England. Energy Minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan has argued that the mine, in Cumbria, will help the steel industry become greener because it will allow steel plants to use coal dug up at home rather than importing emissions. Planning permission for the mine will now be subject to a public inquiry following concerns that it would derail the UK’s efforts to meet its target for net zero emissions.

Furnaces reaching 1,500 degrees Celsius (2,700 Fahrenheit) are needed to forge steel or produce cement and renewable energy alone can not produce those sorts of temperatures. The government’s new strategy sets an expectation for industry to switch 20 terawatt-hours of its energy from fossil fuels to low carbon sources by 2030. That is equivalent to 17 percent of all renewable energy generated by the UK in 2019. Ultra-high temperatures have conventionally been produced by burning coal or gas. That now has to change and the government is betting on the development of hydrogen to help replace fossil fuels, especially in energy-intensive industries. Some 932 million pounds ($1.3bn) will be directed to 429 projects across England to help reduce emissions from public buildings such as schools, hospitals and council buildings through low-carbon schemes including energy-efficient insulation, low-carbon heating systems, installing solar panels and efficient lighting. A further 171 million pounds ($238m) will be allocated to nine projects in Scotland, South Wales and North West, Humber and Teesside in England to help decarbonise industry. These include projects to capture, store and use carbon emissions and projects to use cleaner fuels such as hydrogen. “The Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy will send a clear signal to the market by setting out how the government expects decarbonisation to happen, while improving investor confidence,” Kwarteng said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson last year announced a “green revolution” which he said would mobilise a total of 12 billion pounds ($16.7bn) of government money and create 250,000 highly skilled green jobs by 2030.

Johnson’s government on Tuesday committed to making climate change its top priority for foreign policy as the UK seeks to carve out a new role in the world after leaving the European Union. There is pressure on the UK to lead by example, an aspiration that has been called into question over its plans to build a new deep coal mine in northern England. Energy Minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan has argued that the mine, in Cumbria, will help the steel industry become greener because it will allow steel plants to use coal dug up at home rather than importing emissions.

"A new report emphasises that climate change will affect us all, and fundamental changes are needed to avoid the worst. The world’s most authoritative body on climate change science recently published a report emphasising that climate change is happening even faster, and with more damaging effects, than previously anticipated. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report made clear that climate change will  be harmful for all of us – and not only for a few remote island states or polar bears – by affecting the world’s food supply. Although the Panel has a deserved reputation for being a conservative and careful intergovernmental body, it declared its concern in this report using bold language. Even though the report repeated many of the findings of its Fourth Assessment Report published in 2007, some commentators nevertheless called its conclusions “alarmist”. The report has sparked a discussion as to whether such alarming assessments are useful to spur people and governments to action. Similarly, a new nine-part documentary series on American Showtime TV, “Years of Living Dangerously”, is attracting lots of attention – akin to the reaction to Al Gore’s 2006 movie “An Inconvenient Truth”, which introduced the general public to the threats associated with climate change. Polarising or mobilising? Social scientists continue to disagree about the effects of such alarming publications and films, and debate whether the message is polarising, rather than mobilising, the public. Most people assume that the effects of climate change will never affect our daily lives. The famous picture of a polar bear precariously floating on a fragment of a melting iceberg, for instance, did little to convince people – especially in the developing world – that they should divert resources from economic growth, increased consumption and an improved standard of living. 					 
				 		 But refusal to heed earlier warnings about climate change might be overcome by this most recent IPCC report, which reframed climate change as a food security issue. “Nobody on this planet is going to be untouched by the impacts of climate change,” said Rajendra Pachauri, an Indian scientist who serves as the distinguished chair of the IPCC. For a long time, environmentalists exhorted the public to “think of your children and grandchildren”. No more. This report warned that negative impacts on declining crop yields due to climate change could become more likely in the 2030s, just around the corner. Meanwhile, crop yields could decline by two percent per decade, at a time when demand is projected to increase by two percent each year. Given the World Bank’s report predicting temperature increases of four degrees Celsius by the end of the century, those gaps would widen dramatically. We should stop worrying about the world that our children and grandchildren will inherit, but think of how to protect ourselves! ‘Global implications’ Food security is an immediate concern for every human being, and ensuring it calls for fundamental changes in our daily habits. Individual and common action will be required to achieve a viable global agricultural policy and trade in a warming world. In March, Oxfam, a global non-governmental organisation, published its own report called: “ Hot and Hungry : How to stop climate change derailing the fight against hunger.” In a press conference, Oxfam’s head of policy for food and climate change said : “This is no longer a picture about poor farmers in some regions being hit by climate change. This is a picture about global agriculture being hit – US, Russia and Australia – with global implications for food prices.” The negative impact of climate change on food production is no surprise. Farmers and herders are the best observers of how changing climate, drought, flooding and other extreme weather events affect their harvesting of crops or animals. As early as 2008, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) emphasised that: “Climate change will affect all four dimensions of food security: food availability, food accessibility, food utilisation and food system stability.” While many countries are inadequately prepared for climate change’s effects on food supply, it is the world’s poorest and most food-insecure countries that will likely be most affected. Nevertheless, no country’s food system will be unaffected by worsening climate change. 					 
				 		 Greater food insecurity could even pose  a security threat as competition intensifies for water and arable land. The IPCC Report warns about an “increase in risks of violent conflicts in the form of civil war and intergroup violence”. The decade-long armed conflict in Sudan, the ongoing civil war in Syria and unrest in Egypt are all example of how severe drought, internal migration and economic hardship can lead to devastating instability.   “Battles over water and food will erupt within the next five to 10 years as a result of climate change,” said World Bank President  Jim Yong Kim of the IPCC report. “The water issue is critically related to climate change. People say that carbon is the currency of climate change, water is the teeth. Fights over water and food are going to be the most significant direct impacts of climate change.” Diplomats have been trying since the late 1990s to put in place legally binding agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But they have not been successful. Now, disappointed by diplomatic efforts, many have turned their eyes towards the world’s major energy companies, the biggest contributors to carbon dioxide emissions. This will be the key battleground if a coherent plan to fight climate change is to emerge. Regressive politics If climate change is reframed as primarily a food security issue, is it possible some climate sceptics will lose their influence, especially the members of the US congress who have taken them so seriously? The prospects are not encouraging. Just after the IPCC report was published, some US congressmen outrageously proposed a bill limiting the research activities of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to exclude climate change from its work and to focus only on forecasting severe weather events. These legislators don’t want to hear about climate change science. We cannot have much hope, given the powerful fossil fuel lobbyists who so generously support climate deniers. Their political influence seems sufficient to block all reasonable efforts to move towards a post-carbon economy. Instead, the United States is ready to become the “Saudi America” of the 21st century by pioneering a new energy revolution based on fracking technologies and huge deposits of natural gas. Can this regressive trend be stopped? Not a chance – unless a massive grassroots movement takes hold and changes the political climate in the United States and elsewhere, possibly by saying to the peoples and governments of the world: “Enough is enough!” Hilal Elver is Research Professor in Global Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Co-Director of the Climate Change Project.

"A new report by charity Christian Aid found nine of the worst natural disasters of 2020 caused damages of more than $5bn each. Disasters fuelled by weather and climate extremes brought “catastrophic results for millions” across rich and poor nations in 2020, causing thousands of deaths and tens of billions of dollars in losses, charity Christian Aid said on Monday. In a report, the aid agency identified 15 of the most destructive climate disasters of the year – from wildfires to floods and storms and locust swarms – nine of which led to damage worth at least $5bn each, based on insured losses. Financial costs tend to be higher in richer countries as they have more valuable property, it noted, but some extreme weather events in 2020 were devastating in poorer countries, with generally higher death tolls despite a lower price tag. Report author Kat Kramer, Christian Aid’s climate policy lead, said “climate breakdown” had compounded the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in vulnerable regions. “The good news is that, like the vaccine for COVID-19, we do know how to fix the climate crisis,” she said. “We need to keep fossil fuels in the ground, boost clean energy investment and help those who are suffering on the frontline.” Here are some facts on the 2020 climate-related disasters described in the report titled “Counting the cost 2020: A year of climate breakdown”: ","Climate catastrophes cost nations billions in 2020, report finds",climate-catastrophes-cost-rich-and-poor-in-2020-report-finds,53:00.0,33:00.4,"Climate extremes in 2020 led to catastrophic results for millions across rich and poor nations, causing thousands of deaths and tens of billions of dollars in losses, according to a report by charity Christian Aid.

"Ecologically disastrous conditions in the Gulf are the latest sign of the dangers that climate change and other related factors pose to the Middle East. In recent weeks, many in the Gulf have been looking up to an apocalyptic orange sky with a flurry of sand and dust storms (SDSs) battering the sub-region. Construction of more dams, years of warfare, mismanagement of water, extreme dryness, desertification, and other factors all contribute to this nightmarish phenomenon. In an increasingly climate-stressed planet, storms in these mostly desert countries, which exist in a dust belt , are set to intensify. What comes with these exacerbated ecological crises are increasingly dire threats to human health, economies, and security in the Gulf. These transregional issues also have much potential to be a driver of future interstate conflicts across the greater Middle East. Last month’s temporary closure of ports, airports, and schools in Iran, Iraq, and some Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states underscored the extent to which recent SDSs have taken a major toll on trade, travel, and daily life for the people of these countries. Kuwait International Airport suspended all flights twice last month. On May 16, maritime operations in three Kuwaiti ports – Doha, Shuaiba, and Shuaikh – were suspended  because of the climatic conditions. Sand and dust storms hit Riyadh and other parts of Saudi Arabia resulting in at least  1,200  people being hospitalised in the kingdom with breathing difficulties in May. Dubai’s Burj Khalifa was  not visible after a huge dust layer vanished the world’s tallest building. In Tehran, authorities  closed  schools and government offices while there were  dozens of flight delays or cancelations in western Iran. In Khuzestan, Iran’s hardest hit region, at least  800 people with breathing difficulties were forced to seek treatment. Perhaps Iraq has been the country most vulnerable to sand and dust storms. Since March, there has been a storm hitting Iraq roughly every week , sending thousands of Iraqis to hospitals and the government  declaring  a national holiday to encourage residents and government workers to stay home. At facilities in certain parts of the country, Iraq’s health ministry even resorted to  stockpiling  oxygen canisters. These ecologically disastrous conditions in the Gulf are merely the latest sign of the dangers that climate change and other related factors pose to the Middle East. “In Gulf waters, SDSs are a main cause of sediments that can clog up nearby lakes and marshlands, and sometimes even cover large swathes of the Gulf waterway,”  wrote Banafsheh Keynoush, a foreign affairs scholar and a fellow at the International Institute for Iranian Studies. “Even renewable solar panels malfunction when covered by dust. Given these factors, it becomes evident that SDSs participate in a vicious cycle: Climate change causes the storms, and the storms exacerbate the impacts of climate change. Socio-economic life revolves around weather patterns, so livelihoods are severely threatened,”  added  Keynoush. According to the World Bank, sand and dust storms in the Middle East come with an annual cost of  $13bn . To be sure, such storms in the region constitute a transregional crisis. Mindful of the Middle East’s importance to the global economy from the standpoint of international trade via strategic waterways and energy supplies, countries far from the Gulf will pay a steeper price as the phenomenon exacerbates. Disturbingly, there is a growing threat of violence because of sand and dust storms. For years, the armed group ISIL (ISIS) in Iraq has exploited the lack of visibility resulting from these storms to carry out attacks with greater ease. In May, ISIL carried out deadly attacks  in Kirkuk and Diyala provinces, targeting farmers who were harvesting crops. In April, ISIL  exploited the enormous storms to strike against the Iraqi army in al-Anbar province’s town of Hit, killing two soldiers. Naturally, Iraq’s security forces will have difficulties coping with SDSs that leave them more exposed to future ISIL attacks. With this extreme weather requiring the military to put some of their operations and aerial support on hold, fighters will have an easier time exploiting these storms to wage more frequent attacks against the Iraqi military and civilians, particularly in more remote areas. Beyond concerns about terrorism, experts warn these unusual storms have the potential to spur interstate conflicts in the region over water. Environmental crises related to low rainfall, drought, and declining river levels can serve to heighten tensions between countries. Turkey’s damming of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers is one factor leading to more desertification in Iraq, where water resources have fallen 50  percent since 2021, with a backflow from the Gulf into Iraq’s mainland. “Saltwater is actually coming in from the sea into freshwater areas,” Tallha Abdulrazaq, an expert in Middle Eastern strategic and security affairs, told Al Jazeera. “This is killing arable land, causing salinisation of soil, and ultimately leading to desertification.” Iran’s digging of canals around the Bahmanshir River, a tributary to the Shatt-al-Arab, “has artificially altered the midpoint Thalweg line in the Shatt al-Arab, which historically – and particularly since the Algiers Accords – has demarcated the boundary between Iran and Iraq across the Shatt-al-Arab”, explained Abdulrazaq. “Basically, the water line has been split down the middle between the two. By artificially altering this border, this can lead to a conflict not only over the borders and access to the Shatt-al-Arab, but also to pollution of Iraq’s water supply.” The issue of Turkey’s dams is also adding tension to Ankara’s relationship with Tehran with Iranian officials partly attributing their country’s drought to Turkey’s upstream dam-building. On May 12, a spokesman for Turkey’s foreign ministry dismissed such accusations as “far from scientific”, while maintaining that Tehran is not taking a “realistic approach” to this problem by putting blame on Ankara’s doorstep. As the sand and dust storms terrify people in Iraq and other countries of the region, the serious effects of desertification are only set to intensify while global warming has the potential to make decreases in rainfall more permanent with a devastating effect on the ecology. Among other factors, these terrifying environmental issues can be drivers of future conflicts in the Middle East.

"Ecologically disastrous conditions in the Gulf are the latest sign of the dangers that climate change and other related factors pose to the Middle East. In recent weeks, many in the Gulf have been looking up to an apocalyptic orange sky with a flurry of sand and dust storms (SDSs) battering the sub-region. Construction of more dams, years of warfare, mismanagement of water, extreme dryness, desertification, and other factors all contribute to this nightmarish phenomenon. In an increasingly climate-stressed planet, storms in these mostly desert countries, which exist in a dust belt , are set to intensify. What comes with these exacerbated ecological crises are increasingly dire threats to human health, economies, and security in the Gulf. These transregional issues also have much potential to be a driver of future interstate conflicts across the greater Middle East. Last month’s temporary closure of ports, airports, and schools in Iran, Iraq, and some Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states underscored the extent to which recent SDSs have taken a major toll on trade, travel, and daily life for the people of these countries. Kuwait International Airport suspended all flights twice last month. On May 16, maritime operations in three Kuwaiti ports – Doha, Shuaiba, and Shuaikh – were suspended  because of the climatic conditions. Sand and dust storms hit Riyadh and other parts of Saudi Arabia resulting in at least  1,200  people being hospitalised in the kingdom with breathing difficulties in May. Dubai’s Burj Khalifa was  not visible after a huge dust layer vanished the world’s tallest building. In Tehran, authorities  closed  schools and government offices while there were  dozens of flight delays or cancelations in western Iran. In Khuzestan, Iran’s hardest hit region, at least  800 people with breathing difficulties were forced to seek treatment. Perhaps Iraq has been the country most vulnerable to sand and dust storms. Since March, there has been a storm hitting Iraq roughly every week , sending thousands of Iraqis to hospitals and the government  declaring  a national holiday to encourage residents and government workers to stay home. At facilities in certain parts of the country, Iraq’s health ministry even resorted to  stockpiling  oxygen canisters. These ecologically disastrous conditions in the Gulf are merely the latest sign of the dangers that climate change and other related factors pose to the Middle East. “In Gulf waters, SDSs are a main cause of sediments that can clog up nearby lakes and marshlands, and sometimes even cover large swathes of the Gulf waterway,”  wrote Banafsheh Keynoush, a foreign affairs scholar and a fellow at the International Institute for Iranian Studies. “Even renewable solar panels malfunction when covered by dust. Given these factors, it becomes evident that SDSs participate in a vicious cycle: Climate change causes the storms, and the storms exacerbate the impacts of climate change. Socio-economic life revolves around weather patterns, so livelihoods are severely threatened,”  added  Keynoush.

At facilities in certain parts of the country, Iraq’s health ministry even resorted to  stockpiling  oxygen canisters. These ecologically disastrous conditions in the Gulf are merely the latest sign of the dangers that climate change and other related factors pose to the Middle East. “In Gulf waters, SDSs are a main cause of sediments that can clog up nearby lakes and marshlands, and sometimes even cover large swathes of the Gulf waterway,”  wrote Banafsheh Keynoush, a foreign affairs scholar and a fellow at the International Institute for Iranian Studies. “Even renewable solar panels malfunction when covered by dust. Given these factors, it becomes evident that SDSs participate in a vicious cycle: Climate change causes the storms, and the storms exacerbate the impacts of climate change. Socio-economic life revolves around weather patterns, so livelihoods are severely threatened,”  added  Keynoush. According to the World Bank, sand and dust storms in the Middle East come with an annual cost of  $13bn . To be sure, such storms in the region constitute a transregional crisis. Mindful of the Middle East’s importance to the global economy from the standpoint of international trade via strategic waterways and energy supplies, countries far from the Gulf will pay a steeper price as the phenomenon exacerbates. Disturbingly, there is a growing threat of violence because of sand and dust storms. For years, the armed group ISIL (ISIS) in Iraq has exploited the lack of visibility resulting from these storms to carry out attacks with greater ease. In May, ISIL carried out deadly attacks  in Kirkuk and Diyala provinces, targeting farmers who were harvesting crops. In April, ISIL  exploited the enormous storms to strike against the Iraqi army in al-Anbar province’s town of Hit, killing two soldiers. Naturally, Iraq’s security forces will have difficulties coping with SDSs that leave them more exposed to future ISIL attacks. With this extreme weather requiring the military to put some of their operations and aerial support on hold, fighters will have an easier time exploiting these storms to wage more frequent attacks against the Iraqi military and civilians, particularly in more remote areas. Beyond concerns about terrorism, experts warn these unusual storms have the potential to spur interstate conflicts in the region over water. Environmental crises related to low rainfall, drought, and declining river levels can serve to heighten tensions between countries. Turkey’s damming of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers is one factor leading to more desertification in Iraq, where water resources have fallen 50  percent since 2021, with a backflow from the Gulf into Iraq’s mainland. “Saltwater is actually coming in from the sea into freshwater areas,” Tallha Abdulrazaq, an expert in Middle Eastern strategic and security affairs, told Al Jazeera. “This is killing arable land, causing salinisation of soil, and ultimately leading to desertification.” Iran’s digging of canals around the Bahmanshir River, a tributary to the Shatt-al-Arab, “has artificially altered the midpoint Thalweg line in the Shatt al-Arab, which historically – and particularly since the Algiers Accords – has demarcated the boundary between Iran and Iraq across the Shatt-al-Arab”, explained Abdulrazaq. “Basically, the water line has been split down the middle between the two. By artificially altering this border, this can lead to a conflict not only over the borders and access to the Shatt-al-Arab, but also to pollution of Iraq’s water supply.” The issue of Turkey’s dams is also adding tension to Ankara’s relationship with Tehran with Iranian officials partly attributing their country’s drought to Turkey’s upstream dam-building. On May 12, a spokesman for Turkey’s foreign ministry dismissed such accusations as “far from scientific”, while maintaining that Tehran is not taking a “realistic approach” to this problem by putting blame on Ankara’s doorstep. As the sand and dust storms terrify people in Iraq and other countries of the region, the serious effects of desertification are only set to intensify while global warming has the potential to make decreases in rainfall more permanent with a devastating effect on the ecology. Among other factors, these terrifying environmental issues can be drivers of future conflicts in the Middle East.

"Ecologically disastrous conditions in the Gulf are the latest sign of the dangers that climate change and other related factors pose to the Middle East. In recent weeks, many in the Gulf have been looking up to an apocalyptic orange sky with a flurry of sand and dust storms (SDSs) battering the sub-region.

Construction of more dams, years of warfare, mismanagement of water, extreme dryness, desertification, and other factors all contribute to this nightmarish phenomenon. In an increasingly climate-stressed planet, storms in these mostly desert countries, which exist in a dust belt , are set to intensify. What comes with these exacerbated ecological crises are increasingly dire threats to human health, economies, and security in the Gulf. These transregional issues also have much potential to be a driver of future interstate conflicts across the greater Middle East. Last month’s temporary closure of ports, airports, and schools in Iran, Iraq, and some Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states underscored the extent to which recent SDSs have taken a major toll on trade, travel, and daily life for the people of these countries. Kuwait International Airport suspended all flights twice last month. On May 16, maritime operations in three Kuwaiti ports – Doha, Shuaiba, and Shuaikh – were suspended  because of the climatic conditions. Sand and dust storms hit Riyadh and other parts of Saudi Arabia resulting in at least  1,200  people being hospitalised in the kingdom with breathing difficulties in May. Dubai’s Burj Khalifa was  not visible after a huge dust layer vanished the world’s tallest building. In Tehran, authorities  closed  schools and government offices while there were  dozens of flight delays or cancelations in western Iran. In Khuzestan, Iran’s hardest hit region, at least  800 people with breathing difficulties were forced to seek treatment. Perhaps Iraq has been the country most vulnerable to sand and dust storms. Since March, there has been a storm hitting Iraq roughly every week , sending thousands of Iraqis to hospitals and the government  declaring  a national holiday to encourage residents and government workers to stay home. At facilities in certain parts of the country, Iraq’s health ministry even resorted to  stockpiling  oxygen canisters. These ecologically disastrous conditions in the Gulf are merely the latest sign of the dangers that climate change and other related factors pose to the Middle East. “In Gulf waters, SDSs are a main cause of sediments that can clog up nearby lakes and marshlands, and sometimes even cover large swathes of the Gulf waterway,”  wrote Banafsheh Keynoush, a foreign affairs scholar and a fellow at the International Institute for Iranian Studies. “Even renewable solar panels malfunction when covered by dust. Given these factors, it becomes evident that SDSs participate in a vicious cycle: Climate change causes the storms, and the storms exacerbate the impacts of climate change. Socio-economic life revolves around weather patterns, so livelihoods are severely threatened,”  added  Keynoush. According to the World Bank, sand and dust storms in the Middle East come with an annual cost of  $13bn . To be sure, such storms in the region constitute a transregional crisis. Mindful of the Middle East’s importance to the global economy from the standpoint of international trade via strategic waterways and energy supplies, countries far from the Gulf will pay a steeper price as the phenomenon exacerbates. Disturbingly, there is a growing threat of violence because of sand and dust storms. For years, the armed group ISIL (ISIS) in Iraq has exploited the lack of visibility resulting from these storms to carry out attacks with greater ease. In May, ISIL carried out deadly attacks  in Kirkuk and Diyala provinces, targeting farmers who were harvesting crops. In April, ISIL  exploited the enormous storms to strike against the Iraqi army in al-Anbar province’s town of Hit, killing two soldiers. Naturally, Iraq’s security forces will have difficulties coping with SDSs that leave them more exposed to future ISIL attacks. With this extreme weather requiring the military to put some of their operations and aerial support on hold, fighters will have an easier time exploiting these storms to wage more frequent attacks against the Iraqi military and civilians, particularly in more remote areas. Beyond concerns about terrorism, experts warn these unusual storms have the potential to spur interstate conflicts in the region over water. Environmental crises related to low rainfall, drought, and declining river levels can serve to heighten tensions between countries. Turkey’s damming of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers is one factor leading to more desertification in Iraq, where water resources have fallen 50  percent since 2021, with a backflow from the Gulf into Iraq’s mainland. “Saltwater is actually coming in from the sea into freshwater areas,” Tallha Abdulrazaq, an expert in Middle Eastern strategic and security affairs, told Al Jazeera. “This is killing arable land, causing salinisation of soil, and ultimately leading to desertification.” Iran’s digging of canals around the Bahmanshir River, a tributary to the Shatt-al-Arab, “has artificially altered the midpoint Thalweg line in the Shatt al-Arab, which historically – and particularly since the Algiers Accords – has demarcated the boundary between Iran and Iraq across the Shatt-al-Arab”, explained Abdulrazaq. “Basically, the water line has been split down the middle between the two. By artificially altering this border, this can lead to a conflict not only over the borders and access to the Shatt-al-Arab, but also to pollution of Iraq’s water supply.” The issue of Turkey’s dams is also adding tension to Ankara’s relationship with Tehran with Iranian officials partly attributing their country’s drought to Turkey’s upstream dam-building. On May 12, a spokesman for Turkey’s foreign ministry dismissed such accusations as “far from scientific”, while maintaining that Tehran is not taking a “realistic approach” to this problem by putting blame on Ankara’s doorstep. As the sand and dust storms terrify people in Iraq and other countries of the region, the serious effects of desertification are only set to intensify while global warming has the potential to make decreases in rainfall more permanent with a devastating effect on the ecology. Among other factors, these terrifying environmental issues can be drivers of future conflicts in the Middle East.

Among other factors, these terrifying environmental issues can be drivers of future conflicts in the Middle East. ",‘Vicious cycle’: Storms intensify in the Gulf as climate changes,a-vicious-cycle-intensifying-storms-in-gulf-as-climate-changes,02:04.0,33:07.0,"Sand and dust storms (SDSs) in the Gulf have caused major disruptions to trade, travel, and daily life, as well as significant health problems for those affected. Contributing factors include construction of more dams, mismanagement of water, desertification, and extreme dryness, all of which have been exacerbated by climate change. The World Bank has estimated that SDSs in the Middle East have an annual cost of $13bn, and experts warn that there is a growing threat of violence and interstate conflicts as a result of these ecological disasters.","1. Desertification - the process by which land becomes desert, typically as a result of drought, deforestation, or inappropriate agriculture.

2. Exacerbated - worsened or made more severe.

3. Climate change - the long-term alteration of temperature and typical weather patterns in a place, caused by human activity such as burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil, deforestation and increasing urbanisation.

4. Interstate conflicts - conflicts between or among nation-states, usually over territory or resources, that involve the use of military force.","رودخانه بهمنشیر, دهستان بهمنشیرشمالی, بخش مرکزی شهرستان آبادان, شهرستان آبادان, استان خوزستان, 63159-73971, ایران",30.4025062,48.2470005
"French president issues rallying cry, urging world and business leaders to do more in the fight against climate change. French President Emmanuel Macron delivered a stark warning on climate change at a meeting in Paris, urging political and business leaders to launch an urgent new phase in the fight against global warming. “We are losing the battle,” Macron said at Tuesday’s “ One Planet ” summit.  “We must all act because we will all be held to account.” The meeting was held on the second anniversary of the Paris climate agreement , a pact ratified by 170 nations to cut Earth-warming greenhouse gas emissions. US President Donald Trump , however, has since announced plans to withdraw from the accord, a move Macron described as “bad news”. “We are here in such great numbers because so many of us have decided not to accept the US government decision to leave the agreement,” he said. Macron did not invite Trump to the summit. Several prominent American figures – including Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk – were in attendance. Al Jazeera’s Natacha Butler, reporting from Paris, said the US pullout has left “an enormous shortfall in the funding for the battle against climate change”. Trump, who has called climate change a “hoax”, said he would withhold $2bn pledged to the Green Climate Fund, set up to help poorer countries tackle the effects of climate change. Antonio Guterres, the UN chief, said the Green Climate Fund was indispensable, adding it was “only justice” that developed countries help poorer countries fight climate change. “We are in a war for the very existence of life on our planet as we know it,” said Guterres . “There is no shortage of funds. What we are short on is trust and we must fix this.  This means that the rich northern countries up their engagement and pledge $100bn a year until 2020 for developing countries.” Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, said environmentalists owed Trump a debt of gratitude for rallying thousands to action.

4. Paris climate agreement: An international treaty signed in 2015 by nearly 200 countries to work towards limiting global warming to less than 2°C above pre-industrial levels by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.","World Bank (MC Building), 1818, H Street Northwest, Golden Triangle, Washington, District of Columbia, 20037, United States",38.89883735,-77.04256669

"UN chief calls climate change ‘the defining issue of our time’ and appeals for urgent action from world leaders. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned the world is facing “a direct existential threat” and must take action in the next two years to avert the disastrous consequences of runaway climate change . Speaking in New York on Monday, Guterres said climate change was “ moving faster than we are” and decried the lack of global leadership to address the issue.  “If we do not change course by 2020, we risk missing the point where we can avoid runaway climate change, with disastrous consequences for people and all the natural systems that sustain us,” he said.  People everywhere are experiencing record-breaking temperatures, he continued, and extreme heatwaves, wildfires, storms and floods “are leaving a trail of death and devastation”. As examples, Guterres pointed to India’s worst monsoon flooding in recent history in  Kerala , almost 3,000 deaths from Hurricane Maria  in Puerto Rico last year, disappearing Arctic sea ice and wildfires so big that they send ash around the world. Guterres said scientists have been warning about global warming for decades, but “far too many leaders have refused to listen – far too few have acted with the vision the science demands”. World leaders who signed the Paris agreement on climate change in 2015 committed to a series of measures to limit global temperature rises to less than 2 degrees Celsius and to below 1.5 degrees by the end of the century. But recent studies show the world is off track and likely to miss that target. Guterres said that when he addresses world leaders at the annual UN General Assembly gathering in two weeks, he will tell them “that climate change is the great challenge of our time” and what is missing is leadership and a sense of urgency to respond. US President Donald Trump dealt a setback to the UN push for climate action when he announced last year that his country was withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. But UN officials fear backsliding from other countries such as Australia , one of the world’s worst per capita greenhouse gas polluters, which has scrapped plans to enshrine targets for reducing carbon emissions into law. Poland , which will host the COP 24 climate summit in December, is struggling to break free of coal as its main source of energy. A recent UN study said commitments under the Paris Agreement represent just a third of what is needed to meet the target of a cooler planet, said Guterres. “The mountain in front of us is very high,” he said. “But it is not insurmountable.”    The UN chief described the upcoming COP 24 summit in the Polish city of Katowice as a “key moment” when leaders will be asked to “show they care about the people whose fate they hold in their hands”.

"But to have a chance at making a difference, it needs sanctions imposed by the West to be lifted. The COP26 meeting of nations came at an extraordinary time in world history. Many countries are still battling the pandemic, its impact on public health and public finances. At the same time, the urgency of the climate crisis is forcing transformational changes to economies. The discussions over these two weeks have been critical to agree on a collective way forward and I am proud to represent Zimbabwe at this important moment. In my country, we feel the impact of climate change more than most. Our temperatures have risen by approximately 2 degrees Celsius over the past century, which has seen a significant increase in extreme weather. In the past two decades alone, we have had to deal with 10 droughts. If world leaders do not step up climate action, developing nations at the forefront of the fight against climate change will see jobs lost, livelihoods destroyed, and lives devastated. That is something we must avoid and that is why Zimbabwe is coming to the table with ambitious plans to tackle climate change and save our planet. My government has now committed to reducing emissions by 40 percent before 2030. This builds on a previous commitment for a 33-percent emissions reduction set in 2017. The new target will see greenhouse gas emissions curbed to 44.7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2e) by 2030, a reduction of about 30 million tonnes. One of our routes to achieve that is through significant expansion of renewable energy with the aim of having 26.5 percent of all energy from renewable sources by 2030. This includes investment in hydro energy, solar energy and biomass. We have also reaffirmed our commitment to conserve the diverse wildlife we have been blessed with. We have 11 protected national parks, each one provides a safe environment for our wildlife, including African buffalo, African bush elephant, the critically endangered black rhinoceros, southern giraffe, African leopard, lion, plains zebra, and several antelope species. Last year, mining was banned in all those national parks. Moreover, my government entered a partnership with conservation non-profit African Parks, signing a 20-year agreement in November 2020 for the management of Matusadona National Park. However, with all that ambition, we still need to cope with the shocks of drought and the impact of climate change through necessary social safety nets. That is why I have been appealing for multilateral support to supplement our efforts. Developed nations need to widen access to climate finance as soon as possible. Sadly, the longstanding pledge to contribute $100bn annually to help developing countries deal with the effects of climate change has been elusive. The wealthiest countries must set an example and speed up this financing. All it demands is political will. Another step the leading economies should take to support us, and others, is to end the political and illegal use of sanctions. In late October, UN Special Rapporteur Alena Douhan called for the removal of sanctions on Zimbabwe by the EU and the US after finishing a fact-finding mission. She echoed the arguments I have articulated since taking office, that sanctions and various over-compliance with sanctions have had “an insidious ripple effect on the economy of Zimbabwe and on the enjoyment of fundamental human rights, including access to health, food, safe drinking water and sanitation.” If the sanctions are removed, we would have a fighting chance at fulfilling our plans to become a middle-income country by the end of this decade, helping thousands out of poverty, stimulating innovation and once again allowing Zimbabwe to play a leading role on the African continent. I believe we have demonstrated our willingness and desire to play a responsible role in the international community. We have made great progress over the last three years and addressed many of the reforms asked of us, including providing compensation to landowners who had their properties expropriated in the 2000s, and tackling corruption. We are applying to re-join the Commonwealth of nations and I hope my presence at COP26 is yet another sign of Zimbabwe’s reengagement efforts. I was buoyed by warm bilateral conversations with US President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, President of the European Council Charles Michel and others over the first week of the conference. But the time for words is over – we must act now.

"The lawsuit brought by District of Columbia’s attorney general comes a day after Minnesota filed a similar lawsuit. The attorney general for the District of Columbia on Thursday filed a lawsuit against Exxon Mobil Corp, BP Plc, Chevron Corp, and Royal Dutch Shell Plc for “systematically and intentionally misleading” consumers about the role their products play in causing climate change, the latest action by a US attorney general against the oil and gas industry. The lawsuit brought by Attorney General Karl Racine comes a day after Minnesota AG Keith Ellison filed a lawsuit against the American Petroleum Institute, Exxon Mobil and Koch Industries for violating state laws barring consumer fraud, deceptive trade practices and false advertising. “The defendants violated the District’s consumer protection law by concealing the fact that using fossil fuels threatens the health of District residents and the environment,” Racine said in a statement. The intent of the legal action is to “end these disinformation campaigns and to hold these companies accountable for their deceptive practices”, he said. Casey Norton, a spokesman for Exxon, said the lawsuit is part of a “coordinated, politically motivated” campaign against energy companies. “The claims are baseless and without merit. We look forward to defending the company in court,” he said. The other companies were not immediately available for comment. Racine told reporters on Thursday that his office only learned of Minnesota’s lawsuit when it was filed on Wednesday and had been preparing this long before. Minnesota and DC’s lawsuits are the latest in a string of legal challenges by states, cities, and citizen groups targeting fossil fuel companies over their role in global warming. Counterparts in California, New York and Massachusetts also filed lawsuits against oil majors but the Minnesota and DC lawsuits focus on consumer protection.

The lawsuit brought by Attorney General Karl Racine comes a day after Minnesota AG Keith Ellison filed a lawsuit against the American Petroleum Institute, Exxon Mobil and Koch Industries for violating state laws barring consumer fraud, deceptive trade practices and false advertising. “The defendants violated the District’s consumer protection law by concealing the fact that using fossil fuels threatens the health of District residents and the environment,” Racine said in a statement. The intent of the legal action is to “end these disinformation campaigns and to hold these companies accountable for their deceptive practices”, he said. Casey Norton, a spokesman for Exxon, said the lawsuit is part of a “coordinated, politically motivated” campaign against energy companies. “The claims are baseless and without merit. We look forward to defending the company in court,” he said. The other companies were not immediately available for comment. Racine told reporters on Thursday that his office only learned of Minnesota’s lawsuit when it was filed on Wednesday and had been preparing this long before. Minnesota and DC’s lawsuits are the latest in a string of legal challenges by states, cities, and citizen groups targeting fossil fuel companies over their role in global warming. Counterparts in California, New York and Massachusetts also filed lawsuits against oil majors but the Minnesota and DC lawsuits focus on consumer protection.

"Demonstrations in 2,300 cities in 153 countries attempt to pressure leaders before the UN climate summit in Madrid. Tens of thousands of protesters have rallied in cities across the world,  demanding more action on climate change and aiming to force political leaders to come up with urgent solutions at a United Nations conference next week. The demonstrations kicked off in Australia on Friday, where people affected by recent devastating wildfires joined young environmentalists protesting against the government’s pro-coal stance. Students in Sydney and other major cities walked out of class, saying more should be done to combat the country’s bushfire crisis, which many see as a result of climate change. “Our government’s inaction on the climate crisis has supercharged bushfires,” 18-year-old Shiann Broderic, one of the event’s organisers, whose home was destroyed in a bushfire, told Reuters News Agency. Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg, who is travelling across the Atlantic by sailboat to attend the UN climate talks in Madrid, sent a message of support to protesters. “Everyone’s needed. Everyone’s welcome. Join us,” she said on Twitter.

This Friday’s climate strike is taking place in 2,300 cities in 153 countries around the world, according to estimates by the climate campaign group, Fridays For Future. Quang Paasch of the activist group said governments attending next week’s annual climate conference in the Spanish capital should keep in mind the goals of the 2015 Paris accord , which set a target of keeping global warming well below two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit). “We need to keep taking to the streets, we need to defend Paris,” he said. Students in India’s capital demonstrated outside a waste energy power plant. New Delhi is one of the world’s most polluted cities . In the Polish capital, Warsaw, activists, some in gas masks, chanted and waved banners saying: “Save our planet”, “Plastics plague our oceans” and “Poland without coal 2030”. In Germany’s Berlin, protesters in swimming costumes dived into the chilly waters of the river Spree, holding up a white box in a symbolic attempt to rescue the government’s climate change package. Activists protested at Amazon sites around France, using the annual Black Friday shopping frenzy to denounce what they said was the destructive effect of rampant consumerism, in a backlash against the event that is driven in part by environmental concerns. Al Jazeera’s Rory Challands, reporting from the British capital, London, said activists “were hoping to bring the message to the shoppers, before heading towards the Parliament Square.” Theodore Siri, a 15-year-old protest organiser in London, told Al Jazeera:  “The most important message for us is that the climate crisis is more important than any other issue that’s currently being discussed on the political table.”  In South Africa, a few dozen people holdings signs saying “Not Cool” and “Stop Pollution Now” protested outside the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in the summer heat of the Southern Hemisphere. One protester lay on the ground faking death, holding a sign saying: “Black Friday Reason to Grieve.” Africa contributes least to climate change and is the least prepared to deal with it. Temperatures in parts of the continent are projected to rise more quickly than the global average.

"Demonstrations in 2,300 cities in 153 countries attempt to pressure leaders before the UN climate summit in Madrid. Tens of thousands of protesters have rallied in cities across the world,  demanding more action on climate change and aiming to force political leaders to come up with urgent solutions at a United Nations conference next week. The demonstrations kicked off in Australia on Friday, where people affected by recent devastating wildfires joined young environmentalists protesting against the government’s pro-coal stance. Students in Sydney and other major cities walked out of class, saying more should be done to combat the country’s bushfire crisis, which many see as a result of climate change. “Our government’s inaction on the climate crisis has supercharged bushfires,” 18-year-old Shiann Broderic, one of the event’s organisers, whose home was destroyed in a bushfire, told Reuters News Agency. Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg, who is travelling across the Atlantic by sailboat to attend the UN climate talks in Madrid, sent a message of support to protesters. “Everyone’s needed. Everyone’s welcome. Join us,” she said on Twitter. School strike week 67. 42°19’ N 25°03’W #climatestrike  #schoolstrike4climate  #fridaysforfuture  pic.twitter.com/p2RrVtXm91 — Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) November 29, 2019 Since starting her one-woman “climate strikes” in Sweden more than a year ago, Thunberg has drawn a huge following around the world and inspired thousands more students to regularly skip school on Fridays and join climate protests. This Friday’s climate strike is taking place in 2,300 cities in 153 countries around the world, according to estimates by the climate campaign group, Fridays For Future. Quang Paasch of the activist group said governments attending next week’s annual climate conference in the Spanish capital should keep in mind the goals of the 2015 Paris accord , which set a target of keeping global warming well below two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit). “We need to keep taking to the streets, we need to defend Paris,” he said. Students in India’s capital demonstrated outside a waste energy power plant. New Delhi is one of the world’s most polluted cities . In the Polish capital, Warsaw, activists, some in gas masks, chanted and waved banners saying: “Save our planet”, “Plastics plague our oceans” and “Poland without coal 2030”. In Germany’s Berlin, protesters in swimming costumes dived into the chilly waters of the river Spree, holding up a white box in a symbolic attempt to rescue the government’s climate change package. Activists protested at Amazon sites around France, using the annual Black Friday shopping frenzy to denounce what they said was the destructive effect of rampant consumerism, in a backlash against the event that is driven in part by environmental concerns. Al Jazeera’s Rory Challands, reporting from the British capital, London, said activists “were hoping to bring the message to the shoppers, before heading towards the Parliament Square.” Theodore Siri, a 15-year-old protest organiser in London, told Al Jazeera:  “The most important message for us is that the climate crisis is more important than any other issue that’s currently being discussed on the political table.”  In South Africa, a few dozen people holdings signs saying “Not Cool” and “Stop Pollution Now” protested outside the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in the summer heat of the Southern Hemisphere. One protester lay on the ground faking death, holding a sign saying: “Black Friday Reason to Grieve.” Africa contributes least to climate change and is the least prepared to deal with it. Temperatures in parts of the continent are projected to rise more quickly than the global average. Scores of young Nigerians marched in downtown Lagos displaying messages such as “There is no planet B” and “Stop Denying the Earth is Dying” as passing vehicles slowed and honked in support. Representatives from 200 nations are scheduled to meet in Madrid for the 12-day UN Climate Change conference, COP25 , from December 2-13.

"Russian invasion of Ukraine has left US and other countries seeking more fossil fuel output, threatening climate goals. United States President Joe Biden has urged world leaders to ramp up efforts to combat climate change as the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues to underline the deep reliance on fossil fuels by the world’s top emitters. The meeting of the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate (MEF), the third such forum since Biden took office and the largest leader-level climate gathering before the United Nation’s COP27 climate conference in November, comes at an awkward time for the US president, who has urged increased oil production both domestically and abroad, amid soaring prices. Still, Biden told those assembled virtually on Friday that “climate security and energy security go hand in hand”. “We cannot afford to let the critical goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius slip out of our reach and the science tells us that the window for action is rapidly narrowing,” Biden said. “So I urge those countries that have not yet done so to set a 2030 emissions target to align with the Paris [accord] temperature goal … And to strengthen their targets for COP27,” he added, referring to the goal laid out in the 2015 Paris climate accord of keeping global temperatures below a 1.5 degree Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) increase compared with pre-industrial levels. “At the same time, we need new initiatives to accelerate our progress toward our goals and bolster our resilience,” he said. Prior to Biden’s speech, the White House laid out a series of new initiatives and measures, saying Washington expected world leaders to “raise ambitions” in combating rising global temperatures at Friday’s forum and pledge to join “new efforts and initiatives aimed at tackling the climate crisis while advancing energy-security and food-security”. A senior Biden administration said 23 countries were represented by video conference at the forum, including most of the world’s major economies. Members of the MEF account for roughly 80 percent of global economic output as well as 80 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Underscoring the current diplomatic complexities of global cooperation, Russia did not attend Friday’s summit. China, the world’s largest emitter , was set to only be represented by Beijing’s climate envoy, and not President Xi Jinping. India, another major emitter, was also not included on the official list of attendees. Speaking to those gathered, Biden outlined a US-European Union initiative to build on a September 2021 pledge to cut emissions of methane, a planet-warming gas, at least 30 percent below 2020 levels by 2030. More than 100 countries signed onto the plan at the United Nation’s COP26 climate conference in Glasgow last year. The “global methane energy pathway” announced by the US and EU on Friday would require adopting countries to commit to the highest reduction of methane emissions possible by tapping “new technical and financial resources and/or by enhancing domestic project and policy action”. Washington also planned to spend $21.5bn on large-scale “demonstration projects” – innovative projects to reduce emissions that can be replicated across the world – and urge other countries to chip in to reach a $90bn goal, Biden said. After last year signing an executive order that mandated that half of all light-duty vehicles sold in the US be zero-emission by 2030, Biden urged the forum to “join us in a similar goal”. The US president also announced a “challenge” for the upcoming COP27 – created by the US, Norway and Denmark – to encourage governments, ports and cargo owners to come up with concrete steps towards full decarbonisation no later than 2050. ",Biden urges climate action under spectre of fuel crisis,biden-to-urge-climate-actions-under-spectre-of-fuel-crisis,32:51.0,33:26.1,"US President Joe Biden has urged world leaders to step up their efforts to combat climate change, as the Russian invasion of Ukraine highlights the reliance on fossil fuels by the world’s top emitters.

"Russian invasion of Ukraine has left US and other countries seeking more fossil fuel output, threatening climate goals. United States President Joe Biden has urged world leaders to ramp up efforts to combat climate change as the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues to underline the deep reliance on fossil fuels by the world’s top emitters. The meeting of the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate (MEF), the third such forum since Biden took office and the largest leader-level climate gathering before the United Nation’s COP27 climate conference in November, comes at an awkward time for the US president, who has urged increased oil production both domestically and abroad, amid soaring prices. Still, Biden told those assembled virtually on Friday that “climate security and energy security go hand in hand”. “We cannot afford to let the critical goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius slip out of our reach and the science tells us that the window for action is rapidly narrowing,” Biden said. “So I urge those countries that have not yet done so to set a 2030 emissions target to align with the Paris [accord] temperature goal … And to strengthen their targets for COP27,” he added, referring to the goal laid out in the 2015 Paris climate accord of keeping global temperatures below a 1.5 degree Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) increase compared with pre-industrial levels. “At the same time, we need new initiatives to accelerate our progress toward our goals and bolster our resilience,” he said. Prior to Biden’s speech, the White House laid out a series of new initiatives and measures, saying Washington expected world leaders to “raise ambitions” in combating rising global temperatures at Friday’s forum and pledge to join “new efforts and initiatives aimed at tackling the climate crisis while advancing energy-security and food-security”. A senior Biden administration said 23 countries were represented by video conference at the forum, including most of the world’s major economies. Members of the MEF account for roughly 80 percent of global economic output as well as 80 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Underscoring the current diplomatic complexities of global cooperation, Russia did not attend Friday’s summit. China, the world’s largest emitter , was set to only be represented by Beijing’s climate envoy, and not President Xi Jinping. India, another major emitter, was also not included on the official list of attendees. Speaking to those gathered, Biden outlined a US-European Union initiative to build on a September 2021 pledge to cut emissions of methane, a planet-warming gas, at least 30 percent below 2020 levels by 2030. More than 100 countries signed onto the plan at the United Nation’s COP26 climate conference in Glasgow last year. The “global methane energy pathway” announced by the US and EU on Friday would require adopting countries to commit to the highest reduction of methane emissions possible by tapping “new technical and financial resources and/or by enhancing domestic project and policy action”. Washington also planned to spend $21.5bn on large-scale “demonstration projects” – innovative projects to reduce emissions that can be replicated across the world – and urge other countries to chip in to reach a $90bn goal, Biden said. After last year signing an executive order that mandated that half of all light-duty vehicles sold in the US be zero-emission by 2030, Biden urged the forum to “join us in a similar goal”.

"As the Cancun summit closes, some environmentalists say the REDD scheme is a boon for financers, not forests. As climate change negotiations come to a close in Cancun, Birginia Suarez-Pinlac is seeing red. The environmental lawyer from the Philippines is worried that a plan for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) constitutes a land grab, transferring natural wealth from the poor to the rich under the auspices of saving the planet. Last year, she says, an Australian coal company tried to forge an agreement with an indigenous tribe on Mindanao Island in the Philippines, a poverty stricken area known for its high mountains and lush green rainforest. “The company offered poor tribes people money in exchange for their atmospheric space. They don’t want to cut their own emissions domestically. They want to find a way to profit from the carbon they produce.” Forests help take climate changing carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, reducing global warming – a human induced process linked to wild weather patterns including this year’s deadly flooding in Pakistan and crop destroying wild fires in Russia. Green-washing The world is losing about six million hectares of forests each year – an area roughly the size of Greece – due to human activities like logging. REDD is supposed to be designed to allow companies to buy clean air credits from people who live in forests to encourage them to protect the trees. But some environmentalists say that when companies buy credits abroad through what is now a voluntary scheme, they feel entitled to pollute back at home. “The biggest buyers of REDD credits are the worst polluters – big oil and big coal,” says Bill Barclay, the research director for the Rainforest Action Network in California. “They are looking for a cheap ‘get out of jail free card’ – it’s basically green-washing.” In the Philippines, indigenous people “didn’t understand that they were giving away their atmospheric space to Australians” when they were approached by a non-governmental organisation working with the coal miners, Suarez-Pinlac says.   But REDD and similar initiatives based on trading credits in carbon dioxide are not just about companies purchasing environmental legitimacy from communities who actually take care of forests; the schemes being discussed in Cancun could increase lucrative business opportunities for hedge fund traders and financers. “There is a lot of concern REDD will be brought into a carbon offset trading scheme,” Barclay says. Carbon trading is based on the idea that a price should be placed on emissions. Companies or countries would have a cap set on the amount of pollution they could spew. Those who curtail their emissions below targeted levels could sell atmospheric space to polluters who exceed their limits. The European Union has such legislation; the 27-nation bloc has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 20 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020. And carbon trading figures prominently into this plan, as the EU is by far the world’s largest carbon market.  And, while Europe has done far better than other industrialised regions in reducing its emissions compared to the size of its economy, some analysts think the moves are too little, too late. “We still aren’t seeing key reductions that climate scientists say are necessary,” says Rachel Cleetus, an economist with the Union of Concerned Scientists in the US. ‘Carbon cowboys’ Environmental scientists estimate that the world needs to see emissions cuts of at least 25 to 40 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020 and 80 to 90 per cent by 2050 to stop catastrophic climate change. While Cleetus supports carbon trading as one of many policy tools for tackling global warming, she says: “The carbon market only gets at one market failure: the lack of a price on carbon. We need to get renewable energy strategies in place.” Hedge fund brokers and the speculators Barclay calls “carbon cowboys” believe the free market is the best tool for tackling climate change and better than an extension of internationally mandated emissions targets set out by the Kyoto Protocol which expires in 2012. “The lack of a post-Kyoto agreement means that countries won’t have legal responsibilities to reduce emissions. They will have voluntary ones,” says Steven Sorrell, the deputy director of the Sussex energy group in the UK, a university based think-tank. The 2009 Copenhagen Accord, an attempt to extend the Kyoto Protocol, does not include binding targets. However, rich countries responsible for most greenhouse gas emissions pledged to create a fund worth $100bn per year by 2020 to invest in clean technologies and to help mitigate the effects of climate change in the global south. Eric Bettelheim, an author and CEO of Forest Landscape Development, a company that invests in products that “have a carbon and commodity value” believes turning nature into a tradable resource is crucial for protecting it. “Everyone who is rational about this realises global warming will probably never be solved without the participation of businesses and markets,” Bettelheim says. “Progress will be made on the recognition of forest carbon credits from developing countries as being good currency in the [carbon trading] system.” He accuses certain environmentalists and political leaders – specifically Evo Morales, the Bolivian president – of having an “anti-capitalist agenda”. Morales, whose country faces a major climate crisis resulting from pollution it did not create, wants reparations from the rich industrialised countries in the form of “climate debt”.   Bettelheim’s view on leaders like Morales is shared by politicians with some of the worst environmental records. The US refused to ratify the original agreement while Russia, Japan, Canada and Australia have indicated that they will not sign onto a second commitment extending the Kyoto Protocol past its 2012 expiration date. Before becoming Canada’s prime minister, Stephen Harper called Kyoto “a socialist scheme to suck money out of wealth-producing nations”. ‘Two faced initiative’ But good capitalists, it seems, can even make a profit from a “socialist scheme”. About $64bn changed hands in the emissions trading market in 2007, according to the World Bank. Bettelheim wants environmental regulations for the same reason that General Motors believes in stop signs and other rules for driving: he says they are good for business – and for the environment. Like grain, gold and oil, he hopes trading in carbon emissions will become a fundamental activity in the global economy. “With oil the question is scarcity, which creates a value people pay for,” he says. “In the case of greenhouse gas emissions, the problem is surplus. How do you create a market from that? Legislation.” The commodities trader does not believe an extension of Kyoto is feasible because of domestic political and economic concerns in the countries which pollute the most. On this matter he may be right on the money. Regional carbon trading markets, similar to that practiced in the European Union, are being developed in East Asia by Japan and Korea and in the western US with California’s state government taking the lead in representing a “simpler way forward than having more than 190 countries sign onto rules” as Kyoto attempted to do.  But that approach does not work for Suarez-Pinlac who believes carbon or offset schemes including REDD are a “two faced initiative” from major polluters in the developed world. Even if poor people in forests are paid by polluting companies to protect the land, she wonders “how the money [will] be managed when there is so much corruption?” Even in Europe, which has stronger institutions than other regions, carbon trading schemes have been hit by billion dollar scandals involving corruption and speculative trading which does not take carbon out of the air. “Negotiators talk about ‘safe guards’ for REDD, but really these are non-binding guidelines,” says Barclay. “This has Interpol [the international law enforcement agency] alarmed about the potential for corruption.” ",Seeing REDD on climate change,seeing-redd-on-climate-change,01:52.0,33:27.1,"Some environmentalists are concerned that Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) could be a land grab that takes natural wealth from the poor and gives it to the rich under the auspices of saving the planet.

The European Union has such legislation; the 27-nation bloc has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 20 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020. And carbon trading figures prominently into this plan, as the EU is by far the world’s largest carbon market.  And, while Europe has done far better than other industrialised regions in reducing its emissions compared to the size of its economy, some analysts think the moves are too little, too late. “We still aren’t seeing key reductions that climate scientists say are necessary,” says Rachel Cleetus, an economist with the Union of Concerned Scientists in the US. ‘Carbon cowboys’ Environmental scientists estimate that the world needs to see emissions cuts of at least 25 to 40 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020 and 80 to 90 per cent by 2050 to stop catastrophic climate change. While Cleetus supports carbon trading as one of many policy tools for tackling global warming, she says: “The carbon market only gets at one market failure: the lack of a price on carbon. We need to get renewable energy strategies in place.” Hedge fund brokers and the speculators Barclay calls “carbon cowboys” believe the free market is the best tool for tackling climate change and better than an extension of internationally mandated emissions targets set out by the Kyoto Protocol which expires in 2012. “The lack of a post-Kyoto agreement means that countries won’t have legal responsibilities to reduce emissions. They will have voluntary ones,” says Steven Sorrell, the deputy director of the Sussex energy group in the UK, a university based think-tank. The 2009 Copenhagen Accord, an attempt to extend the Kyoto Protocol, does not include binding targets. However, rich countries responsible for most greenhouse gas emissions pledged to create a fund worth $100bn per year by 2020 to invest in clean technologies and to help mitigate the effects of climate change in the global south. Eric Bettelheim, an author and CEO of Forest Landscape Development, a company that invests in products that “have a carbon and commodity value” believes turning nature into a tradable resource is crucial for protecting it. “Everyone who is rational about this realises global warming will probably never be solved without the participation of businesses and markets,” Bettelheim says. “Progress will be made on the recognition of forest carbon credits from developing countries as being good currency in the [carbon trading] system.” He accuses certain environmentalists and political leaders – specifically Evo Morales, the Bolivian president – of having an “anti-capitalist agenda”. Morales, whose country faces a major climate crisis resulting from pollution it did not create, wants reparations from the rich industrialised countries in the form of “climate debt”.   Bettelheim’s view on leaders like Morales is shared by politicians with some of the worst environmental records. The US refused to ratify the original agreement while Russia, Japan, Canada and Australia have indicated that they will not sign onto a second commitment extending the Kyoto Protocol past its 2012 expiration date. Before becoming Canada’s prime minister, Stephen Harper called Kyoto “a socialist scheme to suck money out of wealth-producing nations”. ‘Two faced initiative’ But good capitalists, it seems, can even make a profit from a “socialist scheme”. About $64bn changed hands in the emissions trading market in 2007, according to the World Bank. Bettelheim wants environmental regulations for the same reason that General Motors believes in stop signs and other rules for driving: he says they are good for business – and for the environment. Like grain, gold and oil, he hopes trading in carbon emissions will become a fundamental activity in the global economy. “With oil the question is scarcity, which creates a value people pay for,” he says. “In the case of greenhouse gas emissions, the problem is surplus. How do you create a market from that? Legislation.” The commodities trader does not believe an extension of Kyoto is feasible because of domestic political and economic concerns in the countries which pollute the most. On this matter he may be right on the money. Regional carbon trading markets, similar to that practiced in the European Union, are being developed in East Asia by Japan and Korea and in the western US with California’s state government taking the lead in representing a “simpler way forward than having more than 190 countries sign onto rules” as Kyoto attempted to do.  But that approach does not work for Suarez-Pinlac who believes carbon or offset schemes including REDD are a “two faced initiative” from major polluters in the developed world. Even if poor people in forests are paid by polluting companies to protect the land, she wonders “how the money [will] be managed when there is so much corruption?” Even in Europe, which has stronger institutions than other regions, carbon trading schemes have been hit by billion dollar scandals involving corruption and speculative trading which does not take carbon out of the air. “Negotiators talk about ‘safe guards’ for REDD, but really these are non-binding guidelines,” says Barclay. “This has Interpol [the international law enforcement agency] alarmed about the potential for corruption.” ",Seeing REDD on climate change,seeing-redd-on-climate-change,01:52.0,33:27.1,"Some environmentalists are concerned that Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) could be a land grab that takes natural wealth from the poor and gives it to the rich under the auspices of saving the planet.

"As the Cancun summit closes, some environmentalists say the REDD scheme is a boon for financers, not forests. As climate change negotiations come to a close in Cancun, Birginia Suarez-Pinlac is seeing red. The environmental lawyer from the Philippines is worried that a plan for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) constitutes a land grab, transferring natural wealth from the poor to the rich under the auspices of saving the planet. Last year, she says, an Australian coal company tried to forge an agreement with an indigenous tribe on Mindanao Island in the Philippines, a poverty stricken area known for its high mountains and lush green rainforest. “The company offered poor tribes people money in exchange for their atmospheric space. They don’t want to cut their own emissions domestically. They want to find a way to profit from the carbon they produce.” Forests help take climate changing carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, reducing global warming – a human induced process linked to wild weather patterns including this year’s deadly flooding in Pakistan and crop destroying wild fires in Russia. Green-washing The world is losing about six million hectares of forests each year – an area roughly the size of Greece – due to human activities like logging. REDD is supposed to be designed to allow companies to buy clean air credits from people who live in forests to encourage them to protect the trees. But some environmentalists say that when companies buy credits abroad through what is now a voluntary scheme, they feel entitled to pollute back at home. “The biggest buyers of REDD credits are the worst polluters – big oil and big coal,” says Bill Barclay, the research director for the Rainforest Action Network in California. “They are looking for a cheap ‘get out of jail free card’ – it’s basically green-washing.” In the Philippines, indigenous people “didn’t understand that they were giving away their atmospheric space to Australians” when they were approached by a non-governmental organisation working with the coal miners, Suarez-Pinlac says.   But REDD and similar initiatives based on trading credits in carbon dioxide are not just about companies purchasing environmental legitimacy from communities who actually take care of forests; the schemes being discussed in Cancun could increase lucrative business opportunities for hedge fund traders and financers. “There is a lot of concern REDD will be brought into a carbon offset trading scheme,” Barclay says.

While Cleetus supports carbon trading as one of many policy tools for tackling global warming, she says: “The carbon market only gets at one market failure: the lack of a price on carbon. We need to get renewable energy strategies in place.” Hedge fund brokers and the speculators Barclay calls “carbon cowboys” believe the free market is the best tool for tackling climate change and better than an extension of internationally mandated emissions targets set out by the Kyoto Protocol which expires in 2012. “The lack of a post-Kyoto agreement means that countries won’t have legal responsibilities to reduce emissions. They will have voluntary ones,” says Steven Sorrell, the deputy director of the Sussex energy group in the UK, a university based think-tank. The 2009 Copenhagen Accord, an attempt to extend the Kyoto Protocol, does not include binding targets. However, rich countries responsible for most greenhouse gas emissions pledged to create a fund worth $100bn per year by 2020 to invest in clean technologies and to help mitigate the effects of climate change in the global south. Eric Bettelheim, an author and CEO of Forest Landscape Development, a company that invests in products that “have a carbon and commodity value” believes turning nature into a tradable resource is crucial for protecting it. “Everyone who is rational about this realises global warming will probably never be solved without the participation of businesses and markets,” Bettelheim says. “Progress will be made on the recognition of forest carbon credits from developing countries as being good currency in the [carbon trading] system.” He accuses certain environmentalists and political leaders – specifically Evo Morales, the Bolivian president – of having an “anti-capitalist agenda”. Morales, whose country faces a major climate crisis resulting from pollution it did not create, wants reparations from the rich industrialised countries in the form of “climate debt”.   Bettelheim’s view on leaders like Morales is shared by politicians with some of the worst environmental records. The US refused to ratify the original agreement while Russia, Japan, Canada and Australia have indicated that they will not sign onto a second commitment extending the Kyoto Protocol past its 2012 expiration date. Before becoming Canada’s prime minister, Stephen Harper called Kyoto “a socialist scheme to suck money out of wealth-producing nations”. ‘Two faced initiative’ But good capitalists, it seems, can even make a profit from a “socialist scheme”. About $64bn changed hands in the emissions trading market in 2007, according to the World Bank. Bettelheim wants environmental regulations for the same reason that General Motors believes in stop signs and other rules for driving: he says they are good for business – and for the environment. Like grain, gold and oil, he hopes trading in carbon emissions will become a fundamental activity in the global economy. “With oil the question is scarcity, which creates a value people pay for,” he says. “In the case of greenhouse gas emissions, the problem is surplus. How do you create a market from that?

On this matter he may be right on the money. Regional carbon trading markets, similar to that practiced in the European Union, are being developed in East Asia by Japan and Korea and in the western US with California’s state government taking the lead in representing a “simpler way forward than having more than 190 countries sign onto rules” as Kyoto attempted to do.  But that approach does not work for Suarez-Pinlac who believes carbon or offset schemes including REDD are a “two faced initiative” from major polluters in the developed world. Even if poor people in forests are paid by polluting companies to protect the land, she wonders “how the money [will] be managed when there is so much corruption?” Even in Europe, which has stronger institutions than other regions, carbon trading schemes have been hit by billion dollar scandals involving corruption and speculative trading which does not take carbon out of the air. “Negotiators talk about ‘safe guards’ for REDD, but really these are non-binding guidelines,” says Barclay. “This has Interpol [the international law enforcement agency] alarmed about the potential for corruption.” ",Seeing REDD on climate change,seeing-redd-on-climate-change,01:52.0,33:27.1,"Some environmentalists are concerned that Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) could be a land grab that takes natural wealth from the poor and gives it to the rich under the auspices of saving the planet.

"As the Cancun summit closes, some environmentalists say the REDD scheme is a boon for financers, not forests. As climate change negotiations come to a close in Cancun, Birginia Suarez-Pinlac is seeing red. The environmental lawyer from the Philippines is worried that a plan for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) constitutes a land grab, transferring natural wealth from the poor to the rich under the auspices of saving the planet. Last year, she says, an Australian coal company tried to forge an agreement with an indigenous tribe on Mindanao Island in the Philippines, a poverty stricken area known for its high mountains and lush green rainforest. “The company offered poor tribes people money in exchange for their atmospheric space. They don’t want to cut their own emissions domestically. They want to find a way to profit from the carbon they produce.” Forests help take climate changing carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, reducing global warming – a human induced process linked to wild weather patterns including this year’s deadly flooding in Pakistan and crop destroying wild fires in Russia. Green-washing The world is losing about six million hectares of forests each year – an area roughly the size of Greece – due to human activities like logging. REDD is supposed to be designed to allow companies to buy clean air credits from people who live in forests to encourage them to protect the trees. But some environmentalists say that when companies buy credits abroad through what is now a voluntary scheme, they feel entitled to pollute back at home. “The biggest buyers of REDD credits are the worst polluters – big oil and big coal,” says Bill Barclay, the research director for the Rainforest Action Network in California. “They are looking for a cheap ‘get out of jail free card’ – it’s basically green-washing.” In the Philippines, indigenous people “didn’t understand that they were giving away their atmospheric space to Australians” when they were approached by a non-governmental organisation working with the coal miners, Suarez-Pinlac says.   But REDD and similar initiatives based on trading credits in carbon dioxide are not just about companies purchasing environmental legitimacy from communities who actually take care of forests; the schemes being discussed in Cancun could increase lucrative business opportunities for hedge fund traders and financers. “There is a lot of concern REDD will be brought into a carbon offset trading scheme,” Barclay says. Carbon trading is based on the idea that a price should be placed on emissions. Companies or countries would have a cap set on the amount of pollution they could spew. Those who curtail their emissions below targeted levels could sell atmospheric space to polluters who exceed their limits.

We need to get renewable energy strategies in place.” Hedge fund brokers and the speculators Barclay calls “carbon cowboys” believe the free market is the best tool for tackling climate change and better than an extension of internationally mandated emissions targets set out by the Kyoto Protocol which expires in 2012. “The lack of a post-Kyoto agreement means that countries won’t have legal responsibilities to reduce emissions. They will have voluntary ones,” says Steven Sorrell, the deputy director of the Sussex energy group in the UK, a university based think-tank. The 2009 Copenhagen Accord, an attempt to extend the Kyoto Protocol, does not include binding targets. However, rich countries responsible for most greenhouse gas emissions pledged to create a fund worth $100bn per year by 2020 to invest in clean technologies and to help mitigate the effects of climate change in the global south. Eric Bettelheim, an author and CEO of Forest Landscape Development, a company that invests in products that “have a carbon and commodity value” believes turning nature into a tradable resource is crucial for protecting it. “Everyone who is rational about this realises global warming will probably never be solved without the participation of businesses and markets,” Bettelheim says. “Progress will be made on the recognition of forest carbon credits from developing countries as being good currency in the [carbon trading] system.” He accuses certain environmentalists and political leaders – specifically Evo Morales, the Bolivian president – of having an “anti-capitalist agenda”. Morales, whose country faces a major climate crisis resulting from pollution it did not create, wants reparations from the rich industrialised countries in the form of “climate debt”.   Bettelheim’s view on leaders like Morales is shared by politicians with some of the worst environmental records. The US refused to ratify the original agreement while Russia, Japan, Canada and Australia have indicated that they will not sign onto a second commitment extending the Kyoto Protocol past its 2012 expiration date. Before becoming Canada’s prime minister, Stephen Harper called Kyoto “a socialist scheme to suck money out of wealth-producing nations”. ‘Two faced initiative’ But good capitalists, it seems, can even make a profit from a “socialist scheme”. About $64bn changed hands in the emissions trading market in 2007, according to the World Bank. Bettelheim wants environmental regulations for the same reason that General Motors believes in stop signs and other rules for driving: he says they are good for business – and for the environment. Like grain, gold and oil, he hopes trading in carbon emissions will become a fundamental activity in the global economy. “With oil the question is scarcity, which creates a value people pay for,” he says. “In the case of greenhouse gas emissions, the problem is surplus. How do you create a market from that? Legislation.” The commodities trader does not believe an extension of Kyoto is feasible because of domestic political and economic concerns in the countries which pollute the most. On this matter he may be right on the money. Regional carbon trading markets, similar to that practiced in the European Union, are being developed in East Asia by Japan and Korea and in the western US with California’s state government taking the lead in representing a “simpler way forward than having more than 190 countries sign onto rules” as Kyoto attempted to do.  But that approach does not work for Suarez-Pinlac who believes carbon or offset schemes including REDD are a “two faced initiative” from major polluters in the developed world. Even if poor people in forests are paid by polluting companies to protect the land, she wonders “how the money [will] be managed when there is so much corruption?” Even in Europe, which has stronger institutions than other regions, carbon trading schemes have been hit by billion dollar scandals involving corruption and speculative trading which does not take carbon out of the air. “Negotiators talk about ‘safe guards’ for REDD, but really these are non-binding guidelines,” says Barclay. “This has Interpol [the international law enforcement agency] alarmed about the potential for corruption.” ",Seeing REDD on climate change,seeing-redd-on-climate-change,01:52.0,33:27.1,"Some environmentalists are concerned that Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) could be a land grab that takes natural wealth from the poor and gives it to the rich under the auspices of saving the planet.

"As the Cancun summit closes, some environmentalists say the REDD scheme is a boon for financers, not forests. As climate change negotiations come to a close in Cancun, Birginia Suarez-Pinlac is seeing red. The environmental lawyer from the Philippines is worried that a plan for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) constitutes a land grab, transferring natural wealth from the poor to the rich under the auspices of saving the planet. Last year, she says, an Australian coal company tried to forge an agreement with an indigenous tribe on Mindanao Island in the Philippines, a poverty stricken area known for its high mountains and lush green rainforest. “The company offered poor tribes people money in exchange for their atmospheric space. They don’t want to cut their own emissions domestically. They want to find a way to profit from the carbon they produce.” Forests help take climate changing carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, reducing global warming – a human induced process linked to wild weather patterns including this year’s deadly flooding in Pakistan and crop destroying wild fires in Russia. Green-washing The world is losing about six million hectares of forests each year – an area roughly the size of Greece – due to human activities like logging. REDD is supposed to be designed to allow companies to buy clean air credits from people who live in forests to encourage them to protect the trees. But some environmentalists say that when companies buy credits abroad through what is now a voluntary scheme, they feel entitled to pollute back at home. “The biggest buyers of REDD credits are the worst polluters – big oil and big coal,” says Bill Barclay, the research director for the Rainforest Action Network in California. “They are looking for a cheap ‘get out of jail free card’ – it’s basically green-washing.” In the Philippines, indigenous people “didn’t understand that they were giving away their atmospheric space to Australians” when they were approached by a non-governmental organisation working with the coal miners, Suarez-Pinlac says.   But REDD and similar initiatives based on trading credits in carbon dioxide are not just about companies purchasing environmental legitimacy from communities who actually take care of forests; the schemes being discussed in Cancun could increase lucrative business opportunities for hedge fund traders and financers. “There is a lot of concern REDD will be brought into a carbon offset trading scheme,” Barclay says. Carbon trading is based on the idea that a price should be placed on emissions. Companies or countries would have a cap set on the amount of pollution they could spew. Those who curtail their emissions below targeted levels could sell atmospheric space to polluters who exceed their limits. The European Union has such legislation; the 27-nation bloc has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 20 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020.

"The EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service says the last seven years were the warmest ‘by a clear margin’ since records began. The year 2021 was the world’s fifth hottest on record, while levels of planet-warming carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere hit new highs, European Union scientists have said. The EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said in a report on Monday that the last seven years were the world’s warmest “by a clear margin” in records dating back to 1850 and the average global temperature in 2021 was 1.1-1.2C (1.98-2.16F) above 1850-1900 levels. The hottest years on record were 2020 and 2016. Countries committed under the 2015 Paris Agreement to try to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C (2.7F), the level scientists have said would avoid its worst impacts. That would require emissions to roughly halve by 2030, but so far they have charged higher. The last seven years were the warmest on record, with 2021 5th but with a small margin to 2015 and 2018. See in the video which regions had the largest geographical anomalies for the year. #CopernicusClimate  #C3S  pic.twitter.com/1sbG5cLdVg — Copernicus ECMWF (@CopernicusECMWF) January 10, 2022 As greenhouse gas emissions change the planet’s climate, the long-term warming trend has continued. Climate change exacerbated many of the extreme weather events sweeping the world in 2021, from floods in Europe, China and South Sudan, to wildfires in Siberia and the United States. “The year 2021 was yet another year of extreme temperatures with the hottest summer in Europe, heatwaves in the Mediterranean, not to mention the unprecedented high temperatures in North America,” CS3 Director Carlo Buontempo revealed. “These events are a stark reminder of the need to change our ways, take decisive and effective steps toward a sustainable society and work towards reducing net carbon emissions,” Buontempo warned. Global levels of CO2 and methane, the main greenhouse gases, continued to climb, and both hit record highs in 2021.

"The EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service says the last seven years were the warmest ‘by a clear margin’ since records began. The year 2021 was the world’s fifth hottest on record, while levels of planet-warming carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere hit new highs, European Union scientists have said. The EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said in a report on Monday that the last seven years were the world’s warmest “by a clear margin” in records dating back to 1850 and the average global temperature in 2021 was 1.1-1.2C (1.98-2.16F) above 1850-1900 levels. The hottest years on record were 2020 and 2016. Countries committed under the 2015 Paris Agreement to try to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C (2.7F), the level scientists have said would avoid its worst impacts. That would require emissions to roughly halve by 2030, but so far they have charged higher. The last seven years were the warmest on record, with 2021 5th but with a small margin to 2015 and 2018.

"The EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service says the last seven years were the warmest ‘by a clear margin’ since records began. The year 2021 was the world’s fifth hottest on record, while levels of planet-warming carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere hit new highs, European Union scientists have said. The EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said in a report on Monday that the last seven years were the world’s warmest “by a clear margin” in records dating back to 1850 and the average global temperature in 2021 was 1.1-1.2C (1.98-2.16F) above 1850-1900 levels. The hottest years on record were 2020 and 2016. Countries committed under the 2015 Paris Agreement to try to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C (2.7F), the level scientists have said would avoid its worst impacts. That would require emissions to roughly halve by 2030, but so far they have charged higher. The last seven years were the warmest on record, with 2021 5th but with a small margin to 2015 and 2018.

Climate change exacerbated many of the extreme weather events sweeping the world in 2021, from floods in Europe, China and South Sudan, to wildfires in Siberia and the United States. “The year 2021 was yet another year of extreme temperatures with the hottest summer in Europe, heatwaves in the Mediterranean, not to mention the unprecedented high temperatures in North America,” CS3 Director Carlo Buontempo revealed. “These events are a stark reminder of the need to change our ways, take decisive and effective steps toward a sustainable society and work towards reducing net carbon emissions,” Buontempo warned. Global levels of CO2 and methane, the main greenhouse gases, continued to climb, and both hit record highs in 2021. Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) concentrations have continued to rise in 2021 .

The hottest years on record were 2020 and 2016. Countries committed under the 2015 Paris Agreement to try to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C (2.7F), the level scientists have said would avoid its worst impacts. That would require emissions to roughly halve by 2030, but so far they have charged higher. The last seven years were the warmest on record, with 2021 5th but with a small margin to 2015 and 2018.

Climate change exacerbated many of the extreme weather events sweeping the world in 2021, from floods in Europe, China and South Sudan, to wildfires in Siberia and the United States. “The year 2021 was yet another year of extreme temperatures with the hottest summer in Europe, heatwaves in the Mediterranean, not to mention the unprecedented high temperatures in North America,” CS3 Director Carlo Buontempo revealed. “These events are a stark reminder of the need to change our ways, take decisive and effective steps toward a sustainable society and work towards reducing net carbon emissions,” Buontempo warned. Global levels of CO2 and methane, the main greenhouse gases, continued to climb, and both hit record highs in 2021. Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) concentrations have continued to rise in 2021 . This preliminary analysis of satellite data, shows that the methane growth rate was particularly high.

C3S said levels of methane, a particularly potent greenhouse gas, have jumped in the last two years, but the reasons why are not fully understood. Emissions of methane range from oil and gas production and farming to natural sources like wetlands. After a temporary dip in 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, provisional data suggest global CO2 emissions rebounded by 4.9 percent in 2021. Last summer was Europe’s hottest on record, CS3 said, following a warm March and unusually cold April that had decimated fruit crops in countries including France and Hungary. In July and August, a Mediterranean heatwave stoked intense wildfires in countries including Turkey and Greece. Sicily set a new European temperature high of 48.8C (119.84F), a record awaiting official confirmation. In July, more than 200 people died when torrential rain triggered deadly flooding in western Europe. Scientists concluded that climate change had made the floods at least 20 percent more likely.
